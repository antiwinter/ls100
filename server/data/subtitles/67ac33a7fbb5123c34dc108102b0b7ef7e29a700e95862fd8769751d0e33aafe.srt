1
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,620
Now, remember,
keep your shoulders back.

2
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,260
Okay, put your arm around your brother.
That's it.

3
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,350
Right, and freeze.

4
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,020
Okay, one more.

5
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,780
Now, just to review,

6
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,360
you're going to follow along
the procession

7
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,240
until you get to the headmaster.

8
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,580
And at that point, he will indicate to you
to light the candles of the boys.

9
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,490
- All right.
- All right, boys, let's settle down.

10
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,970
Banners up.

11
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,770
Ladies and gentlemen, boys,
the light of knowledge.

12
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,750
One hundred years ago, in 1859,

13
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,170
41 boys sat in this room
and were asked the same question

14
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,470
that now greets you
at the start of each semester.

15
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,380
Gentlemen, what are the four pillars?

16
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,610
Tradition, honor,
discipline, excellence.

17
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:16,110
In her first year, Welton Academy
graduated five students.

18
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,110
Last year, we graduated 51.

19
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:25,120
And more than 75 percent of those
went on to the Ivy League.

20
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,340
This kind of accomplishment

21
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:36,300
is the result of fervent dedication
to the principles taught here.

22
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,510
This is why you parents
have been sending us your sons.

23
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,770
This is why we are the best
preparatory school in the United States.

24
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,440
As you know,

25
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,110
our beloved Mr. Portius
of the English Department

26
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,400
retired last term.

27
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,540
You will have the opportunity later
to meet his replacement,

28
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,000
Mr. John Keating,

29
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,750
himself an honors graduate
of this school.

30
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,010
And who, for the past several years,

31
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,550
has been teaching at the highly regarded
Chester School in London.

32
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,730
- Richard, you forgot your bag.
- Hi, Charlie. Hey, how you doing?

33
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,430
Don't worry,
I've got your club assignment.

34
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,780
I'm glad you could come by.

35
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,210
- Thrilling ceremony as usual, Dr. Nolan.
- You've been away too long.

36
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,870
- Hello, Dr. Nolan.
- How've you been?

37
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,160
- This is our youngest, Todd.
- Mr. Anderson.

38
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,250
You have some big shoes to fill,
young man.

39
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,880
Your brother was one of our finest.

40
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,170
Thank you.

41
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,130
- Lovely ceremony.
- Thank you. I'm so glad you liked it.

42
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,420
- Gale.
- John.

43
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,640
Good to see you again.

44
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,550
- Hello, Mr. Nolan.
- Neil.

45
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,560
We expect great things from you
this year.

46
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,850
- Thank you, sir.
- Well, he won't disappoint us.

47
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,690
- Right, Neil?
- I'll do my best, sir.

48
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,570
- Come on, son. No tears, now.
- Chin up. Chin up.

49
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,480
- I don't want to go here.
- I love you.

50
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,490
I'll walk you over.

51
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,610
Do your lessons.

52
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,870
Hey. I hear we're gonna be roommates.

53
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,880
- I'm Neil Perry.
- I'm Todd Anderson.

54
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,670
- Why'd you leave Balincrest?
- My brother went here.

55
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,800
Oh, so you're that Anderson.

56
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,130
Well, this is in case of his sinuses.

57
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,270
And, oh, if he can't swallow,
you give him one of these.

58
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,050
And if he has trouble breathing,
you can give him some of those.

59
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,270
- Fine, yes.
- Ooh.

60
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,900
- Did you remember your vaporizer?
- Yeah, it's in my room.

61
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,240
- Hey, how's it going, Neil?
- Hey, Knox.

62
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,700
- Neil. Study group tonight?
- Yeah, sure.

63
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,240
Business as usual, huh?

64
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,120
Hey, I heard you got the new kid.
Looks like a stiff. Ha, ha.

65
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,830
Oops.

66
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,000
Listen, don't mind Cameron.

67
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,790
He's born with his foot in his mouth.
You know what I mean?

68
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,010
Rumor has it you did summer school.

69
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,940
Yep. Chemistry.
My father thought I should get ahead.

70
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,140
- How was your summer, Slick?
- Keen.

71
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,150
- Meeks, door, closed.
- Yes, sir.

72
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,560
Gentlemen, what are the four pillars?

73
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,990
Travesty, horror, decadence, excrement.

74
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,290
Okay. Study group.

75
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,070
Meeks aced Latin,
I didn't quite flunk English.

76
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,460
So if you want, we got our study group.

77
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,920
Sure, Cameron asked me too.
Anyone mind including him?

78
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,050
What's his specialty, bootlicking?

79
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,380
- He's your roommate.
- That's not my fault.

80
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,680
- Uh, I'm sorry. My name is Steven Meeks.
- Oh, this is Todd Anderson.

81
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,430
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

82
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,680
Charlie Dalton.

83
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,390
- I'm Knox Overstreet.
- Todd's brother was Jeffrey Anderson.

84
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,940
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Well.

85
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,480
Valedictorian. National Merit scholar.

86
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,700
Oh, well. Welcome to Hell-ton.

87
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,200
It's every bit as tough as they say,
unless you're a genius like Meeks.

88
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,990
He flatters me.
That's why I help him with Latin.

89
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,870
And English, and trig.

90
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,210
It's open.

91
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,250
Father, I thought you'd gone.

92
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,050
- Mr. Perry, sir.
- Keep your seats, fellas.

93
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,930
Neil, I've just spoken to Mr. Nolan.

94
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,270
I think that you're taking too many
extracurricular activities this semester,

95
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,520
and I've decided
that you should drop the school annual.

96
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,030
- But I'm the assistant editor this year.
- Well, I'm sorry, Neil.

97
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,520
But, father, I can't. It wouldn't be fair.

98
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,910
Fellas, could you excuse us
for a moment?

99
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,920
- Don't you ever dispute me in public.
- Father, I wasn't...

100
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,550
After you've finished medical school
and you're on your own,

101
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,130
then you can do as you damn well please,
but until then, you do as I tell you.

102
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,420
- That clear?
- Yes, sir, I'm sorry.

103
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,100
Ahem. You know how much this means
to your mother, don't you?

104
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,730
Yes, sir.

105
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,940
You know me,
always taking on too much.

106
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,070
Well, that's my boy.

107
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,780
Now, listen, you need anything,
you let us know, huh?

108
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,410
Yes, sir.

109
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,450
Why doesn't he let you
do what you want?

110
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,550
Yeah, Neil. Tell him off.
It couldn't get any worse.

111
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,930
Oh, that's rich.
Like you guys tell your parents off?

112
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,050
Mr. Future-Lawyer
and Mr. Future-Banker.

113
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,210
Okay, so I don't like it
any more than you do.

114
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,520
Don't tell me how to talk to my father.
You guys are the same.

115
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,520
All right, all right. Jesus.

116
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,550
- What are you gonna do?
- What I have to do.

117
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,390
Drop the annual.

118
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,180
I wouldn't lose too much sleep over it.

119
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,730
It's just a bunch of jerks
trying to impress Nolan.

120
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,440
I don't care.
I don't give a damn about any of it.

121
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,870
Well, uh, Latin?
Eight o'clock in my room?

122
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,200
- Yes.
- Sounds good.

123
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,950
- Todd, you're welcome to join us.
- Yeah, come along, pal.

124
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,620
Thanks.

125
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,240
McAllister:
Slow down, boys.

126
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,910
Slow down,
you horrible phalanx of pubescence.

127
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,330
Pick three laboratory experiments
from the project list

128
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:32,220
and report on them every five weeks.

129
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:37,260
The first 20 questions
at the end of Chapter 1 are due tomorrow.

130
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,110
Again, please.

131
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:03,870
Your study of trigonometry
requires absolute precision.

132
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,840
Anyone failing to turn in
any homework assignment

133
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:14,050
will be penalized one point
off their final grade.

134
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,550
Let me urge you now
not to test me on this point.

135
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,310
Hey, Spaz. Spaz.

136
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,730
- Brain damage.
- Shh.

137
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,720
Well, come on.

138
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,680
- Is he kidding?
- He's gotta be.

139
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,520
- Let's go.
- Where?

140
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,310
Let's go, guys.

141
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,650
Okay, go.

142
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,670
O Captain! My Captain!

143
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,640
Who knows where that comes from?

144
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,760
Anybody?

145
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,140
Not a clue?

146
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:52,560
It's from a poem by Walt Whitman
about Mr. Abraham Lincoln.

147
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,570
Now, in this class,
you can either call me Mr. Keating,

148
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,530
or if you're slightly more daring,
O Captain, My Captain.

149
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,530
Now, let me dispel a few rumors
so they don't fester into facts.

150
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,290
Yes, I too attended Hell-ton
and survived.

151
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,670
And no, at that time, I was not
the mental giant you see before you.

152
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,300
I was the intellectual equivalent
of a 98-pound weakling.

153
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,510
I would go to the beach

154
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,090
and people would kick
copies of Byron in my face.

155
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,560
Now,

156
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,890
Mr. Pitts.

157
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:36,560
That's a rather unfortunate name.
Mr. Pitts, where are you?

158
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,320
Mr. Pitts, will you open your hymnal
to page 542?

159
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,280
Read the first stanza
of the poem you find there.

160
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,490
"To the Virgins,
To Make Much of Time"?

161
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,160
Yes, that's the one.

162
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,830
Somewhat appropriate, isn't it?

163
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,260
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may
Old time is still a-flying:

164
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,760
And this same flower that smiles to-day
To-morrow will be dying.

165
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,550
Thank you, Mr. Pitts.

166
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,560
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may

167
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,220
The Latin term for that sentiment
is carpe diem.

168
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,310
Now, who knows what that means?

169
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,150
Carpe diem, that's "seize the day."

170
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,030
- Very good, Mr.?
- Meeks.

171
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,280
Meeks. Another unusual name.

172
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,030
Seize the day.

173
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,200
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may

174
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,130
- Why does the writer use these lines?
- Because he's in a hurry.

175
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,700
No. Ding.

176
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,080
Thanks for playing anyway.

177
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,550
Because we are food for worms, lads.

178
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,180
Because, believe it or not,
each and every one of us in this room

179
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:53,020
is one day going to stop breathing,
turn cold and die.

180
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,860
I would like you
to step forward over here

181
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,140
and peruse some of the faces
from the past.

182
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,980
You've walked past them many times,

183
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,400
but I don't think
you've really looked at them.

184
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,910
They're not that different from you,
are they?

185
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,700
Same haircuts.

186
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,880
Full of hormones, just like you.

187
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,380
Invincible, just like you feel.

188
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,510
The world is their oyster.

189
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,590
They believe they're destined
for great things, just like many of you.

190
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,170
Their eyes are full of hope, just like you.

191
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,810
Did they wait until it was too late
to make from their lives

192
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,220
even one iota
of what they were capable?

193
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,990
Because, you see, gentlemen,
these boys are now fertilizing daffodils.

194
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,730
But if you listen real close,

195
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,570
you can hear them
whisper their legacy to you.

196
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,290
Go on, lean in.

197
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,420
Listen. You hear it?

198
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,420
Carpe...

199
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,760
Hear it?

200
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,600
Carpe...

201
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,690
Carpe diem.

202
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,440
Seize the day, boys.

203
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,400
Make your lives extraordinary.

204
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,170
- That was weird.
- But different.

205
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,050
Spooky, if you ask me.

206
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,930
Think he'll test us on that stuff?

207
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,310
Oh, come on, Cameron.
Don't you get anything?

208
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,190
What? What?

209
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,600
Let's go, boys. Hustle up in here.
That means you, Dalton.

210
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,440
Who's up for a trig study group tonight?

211
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:07,690
- Sure.
- Me.

212
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,820
- What?
- I can't make it, guys.

213
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,740
I have to have dinner
at the Danburrys' house tonight.

214
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,400
The Danburrys?
Who are the Danburrys?

215
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,410
Big alums. How'd you swing that?

216
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,670
Friends of my dad's. They're
probably in their 90s or something.

217
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,870
Sounds great, doesn't it?

218
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,910
Anything's better
than Hell-ton hash, Knox.

219
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,960
- I'll second that.
- Yeah, we'll see.

220
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,470
Hey. Coming to the study group tonight?

221
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,600
Uh, no. No, I've got some history
I want to do.

222
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,510
Suit yourself.

223
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,130
Ready, Overstreet?

224
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,590
Ready to go, sir.

225
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,330
Chet, can you get that?

226
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,540
- Can't, Mom.
- I'll get it.

227
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,050
Can I help you?

228
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,550
Hi. Knox Overstreet. Uh...

229
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,430
- Dr. Hager.
- Hi.

230
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,350
- This is the Danburrys', right?
- Are you here to see Chet?

231
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,100
- Mrs. Danburry?
- No.

232
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,060
Sorry. Thank you, Chris.
I'm Mrs. Danburry.

233
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,070
- You must be Knox.
- Yes.

234
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,230
Back by 9? Please, come on in.

235
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,900
Chris, come on. What are you doing?

236
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,940
- Chet, I'm coming.
- Knox.

237
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,280
- How are you? Joe Danburry.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

238
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,660
Well, he's the spitting image
of his father, isn't he?

239
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,170
- How is he? Come on in.
- Chris.

240
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,000
He's great.
He just did a big case for GM.

241
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,910
- I know where you're headed.
- I'm coming.

242
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,330
Like father, like son, huh?

243
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,300
- Yes.
- Bishop to queen six.

244
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,180
- All right, I think that's good.
- Another game?

245
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,350
Just replace these numbers here
with X... For X and Y.

246
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,180
- Of course.
- Of course, so, what's the problem?

247
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,730
Do you think I can get in there?
You've been hogging it all day.

248
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,900
How was dinner?

249
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,310
Huh?

250
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,610
How was dinner?

251
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,320
Terrible.

252
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,070
- Awful.
- Why? What happened?

253
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:10,080
Tonight I met the most beautiful girl
I have ever seen in my entire life.

254
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,510
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?

255
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,630
She's practically engaged.

256
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,710
To Chet Danburry.

257
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,180
- The guy could eat a football.
- Too bad.

258
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,810
Too bad? It's worse than too bad, Pitts,
it's a tragedy.

259
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,440
A girl this beautiful
in love with such a jerk.

260
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,010
All the good ones go for jerks,
you know that.

261
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,320
Yeah, forget her. Open your trig book
and try and figure out Problem 5.

262
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:36,110
I can't just forget her, Cameron.
And I certainly can't think about trig.

263
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,740
- We got it.
- Turn that up.

264
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,150
All right, gentlemen. Five minutes.

265
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,990
- Let's go.
- Did you see her naked?

266
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,450
Very funny, Dalton.

267
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:53,160
That wouldn't be a radio in your lap,
would it, Mr. Pitts?

268
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,000
No, sir. Science experiment.

269
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,130
Radar.

270
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,600
Gentlemen, open your texts
to Page 21 of the introduction.

271
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:11,060
Mr. Perry, will you read
the opening paragraph of the preface,

272
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,350
entitled "Understanding Poetry"?

273
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,570
"Understanding Poetry,
by Dr. J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D."

274
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,070
To fully understand poetry,

275
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,360
we must first be fluent with its meter,
rhyme and figures of speech,

276
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,950
then ask two questions.

277
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,740
One: How artfully has the objective
of the poem been rendered?

278
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,410
And two:
How important is that objective?

279
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,050
Question one rates
the poem's perfection.

280
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,210
Question two rates its importance.

281
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,590
And once these questions
have been answered,

282
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,380
determining the poem's greatness
becomes a relatively simple matter.

283
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,140
If the poem's score for perfection
is plotted on the horizontal of a graph,

284
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:51,980
and its importance
is plotted on the vertical,

285
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,680
then calculating
the total area of the poem

286
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,770
yields the measure of its greatness.

287
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:05,740
A sonnet by Byron
might score high on the vertical,

288
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,830
but only average on the horizontal.

289
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,870
A Shakespearean sonnet,
on the other hand,

290
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,330
would score high
both horizontally and vertically,

291
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,330
yielding a massive total area,

292
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,710
thereby revealing the poem
to be truly great.

293
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,590
As you proceed through the poetry
in this book, practice this rating method.

294
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:29,350
As your ability to evaluate poems
in this manner grows,

295
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,510
"so will your enjoyment
and understanding of poetry."

296
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,650
Excrement.

297
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,410
That's what I think
of Mr. J. Evans Pritchard.

298
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,660
We're not laying pipe.
We're talking about poetry.

299
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,000
How can you describe poetry
like American Bandstand?

300
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:56,250
"I like Byron.
I give him a 42, but I can't dance to it."

301
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,160
Now, I want you to rip out that page.

302
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,590
Go on. Rip out the entire page.

303
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,090
You heard me. Rip it out.

304
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,850
Rip it out.

305
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,560
Go on. Rip it out.

306
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,360
Thank you, Mr. Dalton.

307
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:21,190
Tell you what, don't just tear out that
page, tear out the entire introduction.

308
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:24,320
I want it gone, history.
Leave nothing of it.

309
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,020
Rip it out. Rip.

310
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,740
Be gone, J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D.

311
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,990
Rip, shred, tear. Rip it out.

312
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,080
I want to hear
nothing but ripping of Mr. Pritchard.

313
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,210
We'll perforate it, put it on a roll.

314
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,750
It's not the Bible.
You're not gonna go to hell for this.

315
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,050
Go on. Make a clean tear.
I want nothing left of it.

316
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,680
- We shouldn't be doing this.
- Rip, rip, rip.

317
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,050
Rip it out. Rip.

318
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,270
Rip, rip.

319
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,060
Yeah.

320
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,110
Rip it out.

321
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,610
What the hell is going on here?

322
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,200
I don't hear enough rips.

323
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,540
- Mr. Keating.
- Mr. McAllister.

324
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,620
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here.

325
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,630
I am.

326
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,550
Ah. So you are.

327
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,130
Excuse me.

328
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,800
Keep ripping, gentlemen.

329
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,600
This is a battle, a war.

330
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,800
And the casualties
could be your hearts and souls.

331
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,390
Thank you, Mr. Dalton.

332
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,850
Armies of academics
going forward measuring poetry.

333
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:45,520
No. We'll not have that here.
No more of Mr. J. Evans Pritchard.

334
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,190
Now, in my class, you will learn
to think for yourselves again.

335
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,860
You will learn to savor
words and language.

336
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:59,420
No matter what anybody tells you,
words and ideas can change the world.

337
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,950
Now, I see that look in Mr. Pitts' eye,
like 19th-century literature

338
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,790
has nothing to do with going
to business school or medical school.

339
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,300
Right? Maybe.

340
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,300
Mr. Hopkins,
you may agree with him, thinking,

341
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:13,510
"Yes, we should simply
study our Mr. Pritchard

342
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,840
and learn our rhyme and meter

343
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:19,310
and go quietly about the business
of achieving other ambitions."

344
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,730
I have a little secret for you. Huddle up.

345
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,690
Huddle up.

346
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,200
We don't read and write poetry
because it's cute.

347
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:40,780
We read and write poetry because
we are members of the human race.

348
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,420
And the human race
is filled with passion.

349
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:49,380
And medicine, law, business, engineering,
these are noble pursuits,

350
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,540
and necessary to sustain life.

351
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,390
But poetry, beauty, romance, love,

352
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,930
these are what we stay alive for.

353
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,610
To quote from Whitman:

354
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:08,820
O me! O life!
Of the questions of these recurring;

355
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,150
Of the endless trains of the faithless...

356
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,530
Of cities filled with the foolish;

357
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,870
What good amid these, O me, O life?

358
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,450
Answer.

359
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,660
That you are here...

360
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,000
That life exists, and identity;

361
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:31,420
That the powerful play goes on
And you may contribute a verse.

362
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:39,600
That the powerful play goes on
And you may contribute a verse.

363
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,310
What will your verse be?

364
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:55,240
For what we are about to receive,
may the Lord make us truly grateful.

365
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,700
Amen.

366
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,960
Quite an interesting class
you gave today, Mr. Keating.

367
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,750
Sorry if I shocked you, Mr. McAllister.

368
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:16,140
There's no need to apologize.
It was very fascinating.

369
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:19,850
- Misguided though it was.
- You think so?

370
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,260
You take a big risk by encouraging them
to become artists, John.

371
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,180
When they realize that they're not
Rembrandts, Shakespeares or Mozarts,

372
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
they'll hate you for it.

373
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,150
We're not talking artists, George,
we're talking free thinkers.

374
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,810
Free thinkers at 17?

375
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,770
Funny, I never pegged you as a cynic.

376
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,490
Not a cynic.

377
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,910
A realist.

378
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,330
Show me the heart
Unfettered by foolish dreams

379
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,370
And I'll show you a happy man.

380
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,170
But only in their dreams
Can men be truly free

381
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:57,180
'Twas always thus
And always thus will be.

382
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,220
- Tennyson?
- No, Keating.

383
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,940
Hey, I found his senior annual
in the library.

384
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,060
Listen to this:
Captain of the soccer team,

385
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,070
editor of the school annual,
Cambridge bound,

386
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,370
thigh man, and the Dead Poets Society.

387
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,160
"Man most likely to do anything."

388
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,620
Thigh man. Mr. K was a hell-raiser.

389
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,540
- What's the Dead Poets Society?
- Is there a picture?

390
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:33,800
- Nothing, no other mention of it.
- That boy there, see me after lunch.

391
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,800
Mr. Keating.

392
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,180
Mr. Keating.

393
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,340
Sir?

394
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,730
Say something.

395
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,140
O Captain, My Captain?

396
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,060
Gentlemen.

397
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,430
We were just looking in your old annual.

398
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,770
Oh, my God.

399
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,450
No, that's not me.

400
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,280
Stanley "The Tool" Wilson.

401
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,490
- God.
- What was the Dead Poets Society?

402
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:16,330
I doubt the present administration
would look too favorably upon that.

403
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:19,130
Why? What was it?

404
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,840
Gentlemen, can you keep a secret?

405
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,010
Sure.

406
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,900
The Dead Poets were dedicated
to sucking the marrow out of life.

407
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:37,610
That's a phrase from Thoreau we would
invoke at the beginning of every meeting.

408
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,190
See, we would gather
at the old Indian cave

409
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:44,660
and take turns reading from Thoreau,
Whitman, Shelley, the biggies.

410
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,530
Even some of our own verse.

411
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,290
And in the enchantment of the moment,
we'd let poetry work its magic.

412
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,540
You mean it was a bunch of guys
sitting around reading poetry?

413
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,960
No, Mr. Overstreet, it wasn't just guys.

414
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,050
We weren't a Greek organization,
we were romantics.

415
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:05,010
And we didn't just read poetry,
we let it drip from our tongues like honey.

416
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,180
Spirits soared, women swooned,

417
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,520
and gods were created, gentlemen.

418
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,300
Not a bad way to spend an evening, eh?

419
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,940
Thank you, Mr. Perry,
for this stroll down amnesia lane.

420
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:20,530
Burn that. Especially my picture.

421
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,160
- Dead Poets Society.
- What?

422
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,870
I say we go tonight.

423
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,130
- Tonight?
- Wait a minute.

424
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,710
- Everybody in?
- Where's this cave he's talking about?

425
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,620
It's beyond the stream.
I know where it is.

426
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,420
That's miles.

427
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,430
- Sounds boring to me.
- Don't go.

428
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,260
You know how many demerits
we're talking?

429
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,920
So don't come, please.

430
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,640
Look, all I'm saying
is that we have to be careful.

431
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:53,680
- We can't get caught.
- No shit, Sherlock.

432
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,610
You boys there, hurry up.

433
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,610
All right. Who's in?

434
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,400
- Come on, Neil, Hager's there...
- Forget Hager. No.

435
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,230
Who's in?

436
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,200
I'm in.

437
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:09,200
I'm warning you. Move.

438
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,240
- Me too.
- I don't know, Neil.

439
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,660
What? Pitts.

440
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,710
- Pittsie, come on.
- His grades are hurting.

441
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,710
- You can help him, Meeks.
- What is this, a midnight study group?

442
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,210
Forget it, you're coming.
Meeks, your grades hurting too?

443
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,720
- I'll try anything once.
- Except sex.

444
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:25,220
I'm in as long as we're careful.

445
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,680
- What about you, Knox?
- I don't know, Charlie.

446
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,930
Come on, Knox. It'll help you get Chris.

447
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,180
Yeah? How?

448
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,720
- Women swoon. Ha, ha, ha.
- But why do they swoon?

449
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,360
Charlie, tell me why they swoon.
Charlie.

450
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,770
You're not listening.

451
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,360
Look, you follow the stream
to the waterfall.

452
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,160
It's right there. It's got to be like...

453
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,490
I don't know, guys,
it's starting to sound dangerous.

454
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,830
- Well, why don't you stay home?
- You're crazy.

455
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:56,330
For God's sake,
stop chattering and sit down.

456
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:05,500
- Todd, are you coming tonight?
- No.

457
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,840
Why not? You were there.
You heard Keating.

458
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,510
Don't you want to
do something about...?

459
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,800
Yes, but, uh...

460
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,550
But what?

461
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,480
Keating said that
everybody took turns reading,

462
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,100
and I don't want to do that.

463
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,360
Gosh, you really have a problem
with that, don't you?

464
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,700
No, I don't have a problem. Neil, I just...

465
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,910
- I don't want to do it, okay?
- All right.

466
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:39,500
What if you didn't have to read?
What if you just came and listened?

467
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:42,580
- That's not how it works.
- Forget how it works.

468
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,800
What if they said it was okay?

469
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,550
What? What, are you gonna go up
and ask them if?

470
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,800
- No, no.
- I'll be right back.

471
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,720
Neil. Neil.

472
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,400
Oh, shut up, will you?

473
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:06,230
That's for my asthma, okay?
Could you give that back, please?

474
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,490
Could you give that back?

475
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,870
What's the matter?
Don't you like snakes?

476
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,700
- You're in.
- Get away from me, okay?

477
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,410
Spaz,
why don't you check your pockets?

478
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,280
Come on, Spaz.
I have to brush my teeth.

479
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,170
Hurry up, get off.

480
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,290
Cut out that racket in there.

481
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,580
Let's go.

482
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:13,210
Let's go, let's go, come on.

483
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,860
- Let's get out of here.
- Go. Shh.

484
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,540
- Yarr! I'm a dead poet.
- Jesus, Charlie.

485
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:09,420
- Guys, over here. Ha, ha, ha.
- You're funny. You're real funny.

486
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,910
It's too wet.

487
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,880
God,
you trying to smoke us out of here?

488
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,960
No, the smoke's
going right up this opening.

489
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,390
- You okay?
- Arghh.

490
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,850
- Oh, God.
- Clod.

491
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,760
- All right, all right, forget the fire.
- Forget it, forget it.

492
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,020
- Let's go, gentlemen.
- It's like trying to light a swamp.

493
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,360
I hereby reconvene
the Dead Poets Society.

494
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,270
Yay.

495
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,530
Welton Chapter.

496
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,410
The meetings will be conducted
by myself

497
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,740
and the other new initiates now present.

498
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,740
Todd Anderson,
because he prefers not to read,

499
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,290
will keep minutes of the meetings.

500
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,330
I'll now read
the traditional opening message

501
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,410
by society member
Henry David Thoreau.

502
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,580
"I went to the woods
because I wanted to live deliberately.

503
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,220
I wanted to live deep
and suck out all the marrow of life."

504
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,880
I'll second that.

505
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,470
"To put to rout all that was not life,

506
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,850
and not, when I had come to die,
discover that I had not lived."

507
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,060
And Keating's marked
a bunch of other pages.

508
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,470
All right, intermission.

509
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,780
Dig deep, right here.
Right here, lay it down.

510
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,900
On the mud?
We're gonna put our food on the mud?

511
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,200
Meeks, put your coat down.
Picnic blanket.

512
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:21,120
- Use Meeks' coat.
- "Use Meeks' coat."

513
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,070
Don't keep anything back, either.

514
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,200
You guys are always
bumming my smokes.

515
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,950
- Raisins?
- Yeah.

516
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,160
Wait a minute.

517
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,120
- Who gave us half a roll?
- I'm eating the other half.

518
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,130
- Come on.
- What, you want me to put it back?

519
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,050
It was a dark and rainy night.

520
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,590
And this old lady
who had a passion for jigsaw puzzles

521
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,180
sat by herself in her house at her table
to complete a new jigsaw puzzle.

522
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:49,060
As she pieced the puzzle together,
she realized to her astonishment

523
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:52,690
that the image that was formed
was her very own room,

524
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:56,400
and the figure in the center
of the puzzle, as she completed it,

525
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,650
was herself.

526
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,980
And with trembling hands,
she placed the last four pieces

527
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,950
and stared in horror

528
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:08,280
at the face of a demented madman
at the window.

529
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,700
The last thing
that this old lady ever heard

530
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,120
was the sound of breaking glass.

531
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,750
- No shit.
- Yes.

532
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,040
This is true. This is true.

533
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,670
I've got one
that's even better than that.

534
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,710
I do. There's a young married couple,

535
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:24,550
and they're driving through the forest
at night from a long trip.

536
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,460
They run out of gas,
and there's a madman...

537
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,310
- That thing with the hands?
- And he cuts her husband's head off?

538
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,390
- I love that story.
- I told you that one.

539
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:34,100
You did not.
I got that in, uh, camp in sixth grade.

540
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,740
In a mean abode in the Shanking road
Lived a man named William Bloat;

541
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:41,070
Now, he had a wife
The plague of his life

542
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,200
Who continually got his goat.

543
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:45,700
And one day at dawn
With her night shift on

544
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,910
He slit her bloody throat.

545
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,080
- Oh, and it gets worse.
- You want to hear a real poem?

546
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,630
- Want this?
- No, I don't need it. Get this out of here.

547
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,540
- Did you bring one?
- You memorized a poem?

548
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,000
I didn't memorize a poem. Move up.

549
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,710
- An original piece by Charlie Dalton.
- An original piece.

550
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:04,130
- Take center stage.
- You know this is history, right?

551
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,510
This is history.

552
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,510
Where did you get that?

553
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:24,240
Teach me to love?
Go teach thy self more wit;

554
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:26,490
I chief Professor am of it.

555
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,370
The God of Love
If such a thing there be

556
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,000
May learn to love from me.

557
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,910
Wow. Did you write that?

558
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,000
Abraham Cowley.

559
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,000
Okay, who's next?

560
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,550
Alfred Lord Tennyson.

561
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,930
Come, my friends

562
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,970
'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.

563
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:55,480
For my purpose holds
To sail beyond the sunset.

564
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,980
And though we are not now

565
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:01,610
That strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven;

566
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,860
That which we are, we are

567
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:08,240
One equal temper of heroic hearts

568
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:12,070
Made weak by time and fate
But strong in will

569
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:16,490
To strive, to seek, to find

570
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,750
And not to yield.

571
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,380
Then I had religion
And then I had a vision.

572
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,920
I could not turn
From their revel in derision.

573
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,680
Then I saw the Congo
Creeping through the black

574
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:31,510
Cutting through the forest
With a golden track.

575
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,140
Then I saw the Congo
Creeping through the black

576
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:36,720
Cutting through the forest
With a golden track.

577
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,360
Then I saw the Congo
Creeping through the black

578
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:42,020
Cutting through the forest
With a golden track.

579
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,600
Then I saw the Congo
Creeping through the black

580
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,070
Cutting through the forest
With a golden track.

581
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,650
Then I saw the Congo
Creeping through the black

582
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:52,410
Cutting through the forest
With a golden track.

583
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,610
Then I saw the Congo
Creeping through the black

584
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:57,080
Cutting through the forest
With a golden track.

585
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,460
Then I saw the Congo
Creeping through the black

586
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,960
Cutting through the forest
With a golden track.

587
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:04,460
Then I saw the Congo
Creeping through the black

588
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,970
Cutting through the forest
With a golden track.

589
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,420
Take it, Meeks. Take it away.

590
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,880
Cutting through the forest
With a golden track.

591
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,720
Then I saw the Congo
creeping through the black

592
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:26,150
A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.

593
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,490
And don't use "very sad," use...
Come on, Mr. Overstreet, you twerp.

594
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:34,150
- Morose?
- Exactly, morose.

595
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:37,370
Now, language was developed
for one endeavor, and that is?

596
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:41,130
Mr. Anderson? Come on,
are you a man or an amoeba?

597
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,880
Mr. Perry?

598
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:53,430
- To communicate.
- No. To woo women.

599
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,090
Today we're gonna be talking
about William Shakespeare.

600
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,680
- Oh, God.
- I know.

601
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,190
A lot of you look forward to this

602
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,810
about as much as you look forward
to root canal work.

603
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,400
We're gonna talk about Shakespeare

604
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:08,060
as someone who writes
something very interesting.

605
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,820
Now, many of you have seen Shakespeare
done very much like this:

606
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:15,330
O, Titus, bring your friend hither.

607
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,110
But if any of you
have seen Mr. Marlon Brando,

608
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,660
you know Shakespeare can be different.

609
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:26,080
Friends, Romans, countrymen,
lend me your ears.

610
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:30,250
You can also
imagine John Wayne as Macbeth going:

611
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:33,890
"Well, is this a dagger I see before me?"

612
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,470
"Dogs, sir?"

613
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:39,890
"Oh, not just now."

614
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,480
"I do enjoy a good dog
once in a while, sir."

615
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:48,270
You can have yourself
a three-course meal from one dog.

616
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:51,190
Start with your canine crudités,

617
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:56,990
go to your Fido flambé for main course,
and for dessert, a Pekingese parfait.

618
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,070
"And you can pick your teeth
with a little paw."

619
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,740
Why do I stand up here? Anybody?

620
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,250
- To feel taller.
- No.

621
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,380
Thank you for playing, Mr. Dalton.

622
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,840
I stand upon my desk to remind myself

623
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:16,050
that we must constantly look at things
in a different way.

624
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,310
You see, the world looks very different
from up here.

625
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,560
You don't believe me?

626
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:28,480
Come see for yourselves. Come on.

627
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,650
Come on.

628
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,730
Just when you think
you know something,

629
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,490
you have to look at it in another way.

630
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:39,200
Even though it may seem silly or wrong,
you must try.

631
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:41,950
I stand upon my desk to remind myself

632
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:44,290
Consider what you think.

633
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:49,540
Boys, you must strive
to find your own voice.

634
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:53,880
Because the longer you wait to begin,
the less likely you are to find it at all.

635
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:57,300
Thoreau said,
"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation."

636
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:00,890
Don't be resigned to that. Break out.

637
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,310
Don't just walk off the edge like lemmings,
look around you.

638
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:08,900
There. There you go, Mr. Priske.
Thank you, yes.

639
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:13,740
Dare to strike out and find new ground.

640
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,200
Now, in addition to your essays,

641
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:20,580
I would like you to compose a poem
of your own. An original work.

642
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,620
That's right.

643
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:31,210
You have to deliver it aloud
in front of the class on Monday.

644
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,540
Bonne chance, gentlemen.

645
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,580
Mr. Anderson?

646
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:38,470
Don't think that I don't know

647
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,760
that this assignment
scares the hell out of you, you mole.

648
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,770
Take a power train in two.

649
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,820
Three.

650
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,830
- Keep your eyes in the boat.
- Stroke.

651
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,160
- Quick, captain.
- Let's go.

652
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,370
We got it, Pittsie, we got it.

653
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,880
Radio Free America.

654
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:28,930
Let's do it again.

655
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:42,530
- I found it.
- You found what?

656
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,950
What I want to do right now.
What's really, really inside of me.

657
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:48,280
- "A Midsummer Night's Dream"?
- This is it.

658
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,450
- What is that?
- It's a play, dummy.

659
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:53,840
I know that.
What does it have to do with you?

660
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:56,000
All right,
they're putting it on at Henley Hall.

661
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,380
Open tryouts. Open tryouts.

662
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,380
- Yes, so?
- So...

663
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:03,010
I'm gonna act.

664
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,970
Aha!

665
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:07,470
Yes, yes, I'm gonna be an actor.

666
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:09,730
Ever since I can remember,
I've wanted to try this.

667
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,140
I even tried to go to summer stock
auditions last year,

668
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,270
but, of course,
my father wouldn't let me.

669
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,480
For the first time in my whole life,
I know what I want to do.

670
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,070
And for the first time, I'm gonna do it!

671
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,900
Whether my father wants me to or not.
Carpe diem!

672
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,450
Neil, Neil, hold on.

673
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,950
How are you gonna be in a play
if your father won't let you?

674
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:31,750
First, I gotta get the part,
then I can worry about that.

675
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,080
Won't he kill you if he finds out
you went to an audition and didn't tell him?

676
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:38,090
No. As far as I'm concerned,
he won't have to know about any of this.

677
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,880
- That's impossible.
- Bullshit, nothing's impossible.

678
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:43,590
Why don't you just call him and ask him?
Maybe he'll say yes.

679
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:45,180
That's a laugh.

680
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:50,010
If I don't ask him,
at least I won't be disobeying him.

681
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:53,730
- Yeah, but if he said no...
- Jesus, Todd, whose side are you on?

682
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:06,650
I mean,
I haven't even gotten the part yet.

683
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:11,030
Can't I even enjoy the idea
for a little while?

684
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,590
You're coming to the meeting
this afternoon?

685
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,920
I don't know. Maybe.

686
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:29,180
Nothing Mr. Keating has to say
means shit to you, does it, Todd?

687
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,810
- What does that mean?
- You're in the club.

688
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,690
Being in the club means
being stirred up by things.

689
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,690
You look about as stirred up
as a cesspool.

690
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,350
- So you want me out?
- No, I want you in.

691
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:41,320
But being in means
you gotta do something,

692
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:42,570
not just say you're in.

693
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,320
Well, listen, Neil.

694
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:49,660
I appreciate this concern,
but I'm not like you, all right?

695
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:52,450
You say things and people listen.

696
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,210
- I'm not like that.
- Don't you think you could be?

697
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,990
No. I...

698
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,120
I don't know, but that's not the point.

699
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,710
The point is that there's nothing
you can do about it.

700
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,670
So you can just butt out.
I can take care of myself just fine.

701
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:07,720
All right?

702
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:11,890
No.

703
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:16,770
What do you mean, no?

704
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,940
No.

705
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:24,480
- Give me... Neil, give that back.
- What is this? "We are dreaming of a..."

706
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:27,490
What it this? Poetry.
I'm being chased by Walt Whitman.

707
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,150
Okay, okay.

708
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:34,160
What are you guys doing?
I'm trying... You see this chemistry...?

709
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:37,450
Hey, give me... Neil, give me...
Don't be immature.

710
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:39,540
Come on, I need my...

711
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:41,200
Give it to me. Give it to me.

712
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,620
Charlie, help me.

713
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,920
Grab that book. I need...

714
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,220
Whoo.

715
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:17,070
Whoo!

716
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:19,430
Okay, everybody on the bus.

717
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,600
Let's go, boys.

718
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:26,940
Come on, let's go.
On the bus, boys, now.

719
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:32,480
Now, devotees may argue
that one sport or game

720
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:35,320
is inherently better than another.

721
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,990
For me,
sport is actually a chance for us

722
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:41,250
to have other human beings
push us to excel.

723
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,910
I want you all to come over here
and take a slip of paper

724
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:47,460
and line up single file.

725
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:50,420
Mr. Meeks, time to inherit the earth.

726
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,880
Mr. Pitts, rise above your name.

727
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:57,510
I want you to hand these out to the boys,
one apiece.

728
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:02,020
You know what to do, Pitts.

729
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:05,520
O to struggle against great odds
To meet enemies undaunted.

730
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:08,530
Sounds to me like you're
daunted. Say it like you're undaunted.

731
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,730
O to struggle against great odds
To meet enemies undaunted.

732
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:13,740
Now, go on.

733
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,450
Yes. Next.

734
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:21,290
To be a sailor of the world
Bound for all ports.

735
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,030
Next. Louder.

736
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:27,920
O while I live to be the ruler of life
Not a slave.

737
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,290
To mount the scaffolds

738
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:33,550
To advance to the muzzles of guns
With perfect nonchalance!

739
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:41,020
Come on, Meeks. Listen to the music.

740
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:47,110
To dance, clap hands, exult
Shout, skip, roll on, float on!

741
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,890
Yes.

742
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:55,070
O to have life henceforth
A poem of new joys

743
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,900
Aw, pbbt. Boo.

744
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,290
Come on, Charlie, let it fill your soul.

745
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,830
To indeed be a god.

746
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,380
Charlie, I got the part. Rah!

747
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:10,540
I'm gonna play Puck.
I'm gonna play Puck.

748
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,130
- What did he say?
- Puck?

749
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,590
- The main part.
- Great, Neil.

750
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,800
Charlie, I got it.

751
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:18,210
- Congratulations.
- Good for you, Neil. Good for you.

752
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:21,300
Okay, okay, okay.

753
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,260
Neil, how are you gonna do this?

754
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:28,150
They need a letter of permission
from my father and Mr. Nolan.

755
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,100
- You're not gonna write it.
- Oh, yes, I am.

756
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,140
Oh, Neil, you're crazy.

757
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:36,400
Okay.

758
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:40,280
"I am writing to you

759
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:46,320
on behalf of my son,

760
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,920
Neil Perry."

761
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,170
This is great.

762
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,140
- "To Chris."
- Who's Chris?

763
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:49,020
Mmm. Chris.

764
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:52,390
I see a sweetness in her smile.

765
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:55,690
Bright light shines from her eyes.

766
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:00,820
But life is complete
Contentment is mine

767
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,280
Just knowing that...

768
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,790
Just knowing that

769
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:10,120
She's alive.

770
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,830
- Sorry, captain, it's stupid.
- No, no, it's not stupid.

771
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:14,370
It's a good effort.

772
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:17,040
It touched on
one of the major themes: Love.

773
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,170
A major theme not only in poetry,
but life.

774
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:24,630
Mr. Hopkins, you were laughing.
You're up.

775
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,980
The cat sat on the mat.

776
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,400
Congratulations, Mr. Hopkins.

777
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:48,820
You have the first poem to ever have
a negative score on the Pritchard scale.

778
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,460
We're not laughing at you,
we're laughing near you.

779
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:54,620
I don't mind that your poem
had a simple theme.

780
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,910
The most beautiful poetry
can be about simple things

781
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:59,750
like a cat, or a flower, or rain.

782
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:03,090
You see, poetry can come from anything
with the stuff of revelation in it.

783
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,430
Just don't let your poems be ordinary.

784
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,560
Now, who's next?

785
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,190
Mr. Anderson,
I see you sitting there in agony.

786
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,360
Come on, Todd, step up.
Let's put you out of your misery.

787
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,280
I didn't do it. I didn't write a poem.

788
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,200
Mr. Anderson thinks
that everything inside of him

789
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:31,990
is worthless and embarrassing.

790
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:35,330
Isn't that right, Todd?
Isn't that your worst fear?

791
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,160
Well, I think you're wrong.

792
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:42,250
I think you have something inside of you
that is worth a great deal.

793
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,260
"I sound

794
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:51,560
my barbaric

795
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:54,270
yawk

796
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:02,070
"over the rooftops of the world."

797
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:07,980
W.W., Uncle Walt again.

798
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,700
Now, for those of you who don't know,
a yawp is a loud cry or yell.

799
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,120
Now, Todd, I would like you to give us
a demonstration of a barbaric yawp.

800
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,960
Come on, you can't yawp sitting down.
Let's go. Come on, up.

801
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:25,250
Gotta get in yawping stance.

802
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:30,670
- A yawp.
- No, not just a yawp. A barbaric yawp.

803
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:31,970
Yeah, yeah, right.

804
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:35,140
- Yawp.
- Come on, louder.

805
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:36,470
- Yawp.
- Oh, that's a mouse.

806
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:38,510
- Come on, louder.
- Yawp.

807
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:40,150
- God, boy, yell like a man.
- Yawp!

808
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,400
There it is. You see,
you have a barbarian in you after all.

809
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:46,910
Now, you don't get away that easy.
There's a picture of Uncle Walt up there.

810
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:50,490
What does he remind you of?
Don't think, answer. Go on.

811
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:52,200
- A madman.
- What kind of madman?

812
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:54,610
- Don't think about it, answer again.
- A crazy madman.

813
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:57,200
You can do better.
Free up your mind, use your imagination.

814
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,210
Say the first thing that pops into
your head, even if it's gibberish.

815
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:01,960
A sweaty-toothed madman.

816
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:04,710
Good God, boy,
there's a poet in you after all.

817
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:07,470
There, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, close them.

818
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,430
Now describe what you see.

819
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,560
- I close my eyes.
- Yes?

820
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:16,470
- And this image floats beside me.
- A sweaty-toothed madman.

821
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:19,610
A sweaty-toothed madman
with a stare that pounds my brain.

822
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:22,440
Oh, that's excellent. Now give him action.
Make him do something.

823
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:25,520
- His hands reach out and choke me.
- That's it. Wonderful, wonderful.

824
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,940
- And all the time he's mumbling.
- What's he mumbling?

825
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,360
Mumbling truth. Truth, like a blanket
that always leaves your feet cold.

826
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:34,830
Forget them, forget them.
Stay with the blanket.

827
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,330
Tell me about that blanket.

828
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,120
You can push it, stretch it,
it'll never be enough.

829
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:41,830
You kick at it, beat it,
it'll never cover any of us.

830
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:44,840
From the moment we enter crying
to the moment we leave dying,

831
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:49,800
it'll just cover your face
as you wail and cry and scream.

832
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:58,270
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

833
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,180
Don't you forget this.

834
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:07,090
- Atta boy, Pittsie, inhale deeply.
- My dad collects a lot of pipes.

835
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:10,210
- Really? Mine's got 30.
- Your parents collect pipes?

836
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:12,220
Oh, that's really interesting.

837
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,380
Come on, Knox. Join in.

838
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,390
We're from the government.
We're here to help.

839
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,800
- What's wrong?
- It's Chris.

840
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,690
- Here's a picture of Chris for you.
- Put that in your pipe and smoke it.

841
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,640
- That's not funny.
- Knock it off.

842
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:27,400
- Smoke your pipes.
- Okay.

843
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:28,930
Neil.

844
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:32,280
Friends, scholars, Welton men.

845
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,740
- What is that, Neil?
- Duh. It's a lamp, Meeks.

846
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:38,990
No, this is the god of the cave.

847
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,240
The god of the cave?

848
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:44,870
Charlie, what are you doing?

849
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:46,660
What do you say we start this meeting?

850
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,250
Yeah, just... I need a light.

851
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,840
- Who's got a light?
- Did you bring the earplugs?

852
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:55,840
Gentlemen, "Poetrusic,"
by Charles Dalton.

853
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:57,800
- Oh, boy.
- He's gonna play.

854
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:01,550
Oh, no.

855
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:04,340
Laughing, crying, tumbling, mumbling.

856
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:07,360
Gotta do more. Gotta be more.

857
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:15,400
Chaos screaming, chaos dreaming
Gotta do more, gotta be more.

858
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,390
Wow.

859
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:50,930
- That was nice.
- That was great.

860
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:52,730
Where did you learn to play like that?

861
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:55,820
My parents made me take the clarinet
for years.

862
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:58,070
- I love the clarinet.
- I hated it.

863
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:01,320
The saxophone.

864
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:05,240
The saxophone is more sonorous.

865
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:06,700
Ooh.

866
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,660
- Vocabulary.
- Look at him.

867
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,960
I can't take it anymore. If I don't
have Chris, I'm gonna kill myself.

868
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:14,920
Knoxious, you've gotta calm down.

869
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:17,000
No, Charlie.

870
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:21,340
That's just my problem.
I've been calm all my life.

871
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,800
- I'm gonna do something about that.
- Where you going?

872
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,640
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna call her. Yeah.

873
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:35,530
Hello?

874
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:38,650
She's gonna hate me.

875
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,690
The Danburrys will hate me.

876
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:45,620
My parents will kill me.

877
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:52,450
All right, goddamn it.

878
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:56,220
You're right. Carpe diem.

879
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:58,670
Even if it kills me.

880
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:08,890
- Hello?
- Hello, Chris?

881
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:12,680
- Yes?
- Hi, this is Knox Overstreet.

882
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:17,020
Oh, yes, Knox. Glad you called.

883
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,310
She's glad I called.

884
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:20,990
Listen, Chet's parents
are going out of town this weekend

885
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,320
and he's having a party.

886
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:24,950
- Would you like to come?
- Would I like to come to a party?

887
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,830
- Yes. Say yes.
- Friday?

888
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,160
- Well, sure.
- About 7?

889
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:30,160
- Okay, great. I'll be there, Chris.
- Okay.

890
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:31,870
Friday night at the Danburrys.

891
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:33,500
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay, bye.

892
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:35,790
Thank you. I'll see you. Bye.

893
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:39,340
Yawp!

894
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:41,460
Can you believe it?

895
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:44,300
She was gonna call me.

896
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:46,810
She invited me to a party with her.

897
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:49,680
- At Chet Danburry's house?
- Yeah.

898
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:52,270
- Well?
- So?

899
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:55,980
So you don't really think
she means you're going with her?

900
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,480
Well, of course not, Charlie,
but that's not the point.

901
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:04,370
- That's not the point at all.
- What is the point?

902
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:09,290
The point, Charlie,

903
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:12,450
is, uh...

904
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:16,880
- Yeah?
that she was thinking about me.

905
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:22,500
I've only met her once, and already,
she's thinking about me.

906
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:25,340
Damn it. It's gonna happen, guys.

907
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,470
I feel it.

908
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:32,310
She is going to be mine.

909
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:37,100
Carpe. Carpe.

910
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:43,070
No grades at stake, gentlemen.
Just take a stroll.

911
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,450
There it is.

912
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,380
I don't know, but I've been told

913
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:04,290
I don't know, but I've been told

914
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:06,210
Doing poetry is old

915
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:07,680
Doing poetry is old

916
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:14,810
Left, left, left, right, left.

917
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,470
Left, halt.

918
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,190
Thank you, gentlemen.

919
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:24,110
If you noticed, everyone started off
with their own stride, their own pace.

920
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:26,570
Mr. Pitts, taking his time.

921
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:28,530
He knew he'll get there one day.

922
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,320
Mr. Cameron,
you could see him thinking,

923
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:34,080
"Is this right? It might be right.
I know that... Maybe not. I don't know."

924
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:37,660
Mr. Overstreet's, driven by deeper force.

925
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,950
Yes, we know that.

926
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:42,670
All right, now, I didn't bring them up here
to ridicule them.

927
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:45,330
I brought them up here
to illustrate the point of conformity.

928
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:48,970
The difficulty in maintaining
your own beliefs in the face of others.

929
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:51,260
Now, those of you,
I see the look in your eyes like,

930
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,520
"I would have walked differently."

931
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:56,350
Well, ask yourselves
why you were clapping.

932
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,650
Now, we all have a great need
for acceptance.

933
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:02,610
But you must trust
that your beliefs are unique, your own.

934
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:05,190
Even though others
may think them odd or unpopular.

935
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:08,780
Even though the herd may go,
"That's baa-d."

936
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:13,790
Robert Frost said,
"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,

937
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:17,830
I took the one less travelled by,
and that has made all the difference."

938
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,460
Now, I want you to find your own walk
right now.

939
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:24,290
Your own way of striding, pacing.
Any direction, anything you want.

940
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:27,050
Whether it's proud,
whether it's silly, anything.

941
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:30,800
Gentlemen, the courtyard is yours.

942
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:36,970
You don't have to perform,
just make it for yourself.

943
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,860
Mr. Dalton, you be joining us?

944
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:43,190
Exercising the right not to walk.

945
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:47,610
Thank you, Mr. Dalton.
You just illustrated the point.

946
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:50,150
Swim against the stream.

947
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:02,870
Todd?

948
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:06,790
- Hey.
- Hey.

949
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:09,880
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

950
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:15,140
- Today's my birthday.
- Is today your birthday?

951
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:17,220
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

952
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,100
- What'd you get?
- My parents gave me this.

953
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:22,400
Isn't this the same desk...?

954
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:25,600
Yeah, they gave me the same thing
as last year.

955
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:30,280
- Oh.
- Oh.

956
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:33,490
Maybe they thought
you needed another one.

957
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,070
Maybe they weren't thinking
about anything at all.

958
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,590
The funny thing is about this is,
I didn't even like it the first time.

959
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:50,720
Todd, I think you're underestimating
the value of this desk set.

960
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:58,010
I mean, who would want a football,
or a baseball, or...?

961
01:06:58,230 --> 01:06:59,340
Or a car?

962
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,730
Or a car, if they could have a desk set
as wonderful as this one?

963
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:06,860
I mean, if I were ever going to buy
a desk set twice,

964
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:10,740
I would probably buy this one
both times.

965
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:16,280
In fact, its shape is...

966
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:20,120
It's rather aerodynamic, isn't it?

967
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:23,540
I can feel it.

968
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,330
Phew.

969
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:28,670
This desk set wants to fly.

970
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:32,930
Todd?

971
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:37,590
The world's first unmanned
flying desk set.

972
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,930
Whew. Ha, ha.

973
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,560
Oh, my.

974
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:47,220
Well, I wouldn't worry.

975
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,730
You'll get another one next year.

976
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:54,070
To live deep
And suck out all the marrow of life.

977
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,950
To put to rout all that was not life.

978
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,240
Oh, my God.

979
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:04,250
- Is this it?
- Yeah, this is it.

980
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:06,710
Go ahead, go on in. It's my cave.

981
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:08,710
- Watch your step.
- We're not gonna slip, are we?

982
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,250
Uh-oh.

983
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:12,170
Hi.

984
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:13,750
- Unh.
- Hello.

985
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:15,960
- Hello.
- Hi, guys.

986
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:19,050
Meet, uh, Gloria and...

987
01:08:19,230 --> 01:08:20,810
- Tina.
- Tina.

988
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:23,890
This is the pledge class
of the Dead Poets Society.

989
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:25,430
- Hello.
- Hey, how do you do?

990
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:26,850
- Hello.
- Hi.

991
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:28,770
Guys, move, move.

992
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:31,730
Come on, folks, it's Friday night.
Let's get on with the meeting.

993
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:32,940
Excuse me.

994
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:34,950
CHRIS Hello?

995
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,900
In keeping with the spirit of passionate
experimentation of the Dead Poets,

996
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:41,200
I'm giving up the name Charles Dalton.

997
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:43,910
From now on, call me Nuwanda.

998
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:46,490
- Nuwanda?
- Nuwanda?

999
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:50,540
Okay.

1000
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:02,140
Hello? Hello, Chris?

1001
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:09,220
- Knox.
- Hi.

1002
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,310
You made it, great.

1003
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:12,820
- Bring anybody?
- No.

1004
01:09:12,990 --> 01:09:15,730
No? Ginny Danburry's here.

1005
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:17,070
Look, I have to go find Chet.

1006
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,480
Why don't you go downstairs?
That's where everybody is.

1007
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:21,240
- But, Chris...
- Make yourself at home.

1008
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:22,820
But I...

1009
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,390
Hey, guys.

1010
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:47,230
Hey, you Mutt Sanders' brother?

1011
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:50,400
Bubba, this guy look like
Mutt Sanders to you, or what?

1012
01:09:50,570 --> 01:09:52,560
You're his brother?

1013
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:55,890
No relation. Never heard of him.
Sorry, guys.

1014
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:57,110
Where's your manners?

1015
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,860
There's Mutt Sanders' brother,
we don't even offer him a drink.

1016
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:02,490
- Have some whisky, pal.
- Yeah.

1017
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:04,200
I don't really drink...

1018
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:07,160
- To Mutt.
- To Mutt.

1019
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:09,420
To Mutt.

1020
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:13,950
Now, how the hell is old Mutt anyway?

1021
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:16,040
Yeah, what's old Mutter
been up to, huh?

1022
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:19,420
I don't really know Mutt.

1023
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:23,390
- To the Mighty Mutt.
- To Mighty Mutt.

1024
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,590
To Mighty Mutt.

1025
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:32,560
Well, listen, I gotta go find Patsy.

1026
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:35,820
Say hello to Mutt for me, okay?

1027
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:39,400
- Will do.
- Hell of a guy, your old brother, Mutt.

1028
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:43,990
Are we gonna have a meeting, or what?

1029
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:47,500
Yeah, if you guys don't have a meeting,
how do we know if we want to join?

1030
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:50,120
Join?

1031
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:53,380
Shall I compare thee
To a summer's day?

1032
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:56,040
Thou art more lovely
And more temperate.

1033
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:59,880
- That's so sweet.
- I made that up just for you.

1034
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:01,840
You did?

1035
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,050
I'll write one for you too, Gloria.

1036
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:11,140
She walks in beauty like the night

1037
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,770
She walks in beauty like the night

1038
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:19,650
Of cloudless climes and starry skies

1039
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:22,940
All that's best of dark and bright

1040
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,820
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;

1041
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,360
That's beautiful.

1042
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:31,490
There's plenty more
where that came from.

1043
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:16,870
God help me.

1044
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:33,260
Carpe diem.

1045
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:06,080
What, you don't remember?

1046
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:07,500
What, are you kidding?

1047
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:11,720
- Chet, Chet, look.
- What?

1048
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,270
It's Mutt Sanders' brother.

1049
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,640
Huh?

1050
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:17,300
- Knox...?
- He's feeling up your girl.

1051
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,600
What are you doing?

1052
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:21,690
- What the hell are you doing?
- Chet.

1053
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:24,650
- Chet, don't.
- Chet, I know this looks bad, but...

1054
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:26,360
- Ahh!
- Chet, no, you'll hurt him.

1055
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:28,410
No, Chet, stop it.

1056
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:30,360
- Jesus.
- Leave him alone.

1057
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:32,490
- Goddamn.
- Chet, stop it.

1058
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:34,370
Bastard.

1059
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:37,540
- Knox, are you all right?
- Chris, get the hell away from him.

1060
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:38,920
- Chet, you hurt him.
- Good.

1061
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:42,200
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1062
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:44,250
Next time I see you, you die.

1063
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:49,800
Go ahead, pass it around.

1064
01:13:58,690 --> 01:14:02,230
Me and Pitts
are working on a hi-fi system.

1065
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:05,610
It shouldn't be that hard to put together.

1066
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:09,520
Yeah, I might be going to Yale.

1067
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:12,200
But I might not.

1068
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:14,700
Don't you guys
miss having girls around here?

1069
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,360
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1070
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:18,870
That's part of what this club is about.

1071
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,200
In fact, I'd like to announce

1072
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:24,620
I published an article in the school paper
in the name of the Dead Poets.

1073
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:26,250
What?

1074
01:14:26,430 --> 01:14:28,790
- Demanding girls be admitted to Welton.
- You didn't.

1075
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:31,880
- So we can all stop beating off.
- How did you do that?

1076
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:34,050
I'm one of the proofers.
I slipped the article in.

1077
01:14:34,230 --> 01:14:37,340
- Look, it's over now.
- Why? Nobody knows who we are.

1078
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,720
Don't you think
they're gonna figure out who wrote it?

1079
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:43,390
They're gonna come to you and ask
to know what the Dead Poets Society is.

1080
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:45,930
Charlie, you had no right
to do something like that.

1081
01:14:46,110 --> 01:14:48,400
It's Nuwanda, Cameron.

1082
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:51,320
That's right, it's Nuwanda.

1083
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:54,490
And are we just playing around out there,
or do we mean what we say?

1084
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:57,620
If all we do is come together
and read a bunch of poems to each other,

1085
01:14:57,790 --> 01:14:58,910
what the hell are we doing?

1086
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,540
All right, but you still
shouldn't have done it, Charlie.

1087
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:04,080
This could mean trouble.
You don't speak for the club.

1088
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:06,750
Hey, would you not worry
about your precious little neck?

1089
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:10,170
If they catch me,
I'll tell them I made it up.

1090
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:26,680
Fine.

1091
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:38,820
Sit.

1092
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:46,040
This week's issue of Welton Honor,

1093
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:49,710
there appeared a profane
and unauthorized article.

1094
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:55,010
Rather than spend my valuable time
ferreting out the guilty persons...

1095
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:57,760
And let me assure you, I will find them.

1096
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,890
I'm asking any and all students
who know anything about this article

1097
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:05,230
to make themselves known
here and now.

1098
01:16:07,190 --> 01:16:09,480
Whoever the guilty persons are,

1099
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:13,110
this is your only chance
to avoid expulsion from this school.

1100
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:20,950
Welton Academy, hello?

1101
01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:23,580
Yes, he is. Just a moment.

1102
01:16:24,590 --> 01:16:26,700
Mr. Nolan, it's for you.

1103
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:30,790
It's God.
He says we should have girls at Welton.

1104
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:48,730
Wipe that smirk off your face.

1105
01:16:50,570 --> 01:16:52,610
If you think, Mr. Dalton,
that you're the first

1106
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:55,070
to try to get thrown out of this school,
think again.

1107
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,820
Others have had similar notions

1108
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:59,450
and have failed
just as surely as you will fail.

1109
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:00,830
Assume the position.

1110
01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:16,210
Count aloud, Mr. Dalton.

1111
01:17:20,730 --> 01:17:22,390
One.

1112
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,930
Two.

1113
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:33,690
Three.

1114
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:36,270
Four.

1115
01:17:37,990 --> 01:17:39,030
Five.

1116
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,530
What is this Dead Poets Society?
I want names.

1117
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,020
- You kicked out?
- No.

1118
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:15,190
So, what happened?

1119
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:21,570
I'm to turn everybody in,
apologize to the school,

1120
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:23,780
and all will be forgiven.

1121
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,990
So, what are you gonna do?

1122
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:29,450
- Charlie.
- Damn it, Neil.

1123
01:18:29,630 --> 01:18:32,120
The name is Nuwanda.

1124
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:39,720
Excuse me.

1125
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:43,100
- May we have a word, Mr. Keating?
- Certainly.

1126
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:53,110
This was my first classroom, John.
Did you know that?

1127
01:18:54,190 --> 01:18:58,030
- My first desk.
- I didn't know you taught, Mr. Nolan.

1128
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,030
English.

1129
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,690
Long before your time.

1130
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:05,480
It was hard giving it up, I can tell you.

1131
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:11,210
I'm hearing rumors, John,

1132
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:14,210
about some unorthodox teaching methods,
in your classroom.

1133
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:18,840
I'm not saying they've had anything to do
with the Dalton boy's outburst,

1134
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:23,630
but I don't think I have to warn you,
boys his age are very impressionable.

1135
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:27,140
Well, your reprimand
made quite an impression, I'm sure.

1136
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:32,720
What was going on in the courtyard
the other day?

1137
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:33,930
Courtyard?

1138
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:35,890
Yeah, boys marching,
clapping in unison.

1139
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:38,530
Oh, that.
That was an exercise to prove a point.

1140
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:39,940
Dangers of conformity.

1141
01:19:40,110 --> 01:19:42,820
Well, John, the curriculum here is set.
It's proven, it works.

1142
01:19:42,990 --> 01:19:45,570
If you question it, what's to prevent them
from doing the same?

1143
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:48,490
I thought the idea of education
was to learn to think for yourself.

1144
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:50,700
At these boys' age? Not on your life.

1145
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:55,160
Tradition, John. Discipline.

1146
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:59,160
Prepare them for college
and the rest will take care of itself.

1147
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:05,550
Creak.

1148
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:10,800
He starts walking around
towards my left. Creak.

1149
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:13,140
Creak.

1150
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:16,810
"Assume the position, Mr. Dalton."

1151
01:20:17,690 --> 01:20:19,350
It's all right, gentlemen.

1152
01:20:19,530 --> 01:20:22,320
- Mr. Keating.
- Mr. Dalton.

1153
01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:24,780
That was a pretty lame stunt
you pulled today.

1154
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:26,660
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?

1155
01:20:26,830 --> 01:20:29,280
What about carpe diem,
sucking all the marrow out of life...?

1156
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:33,200
Sucking the marrow out of life
doesn't mean choking on the bone.

1157
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:38,290
Sure, there's a time for daring,
and there's a time for caution.

1158
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:40,380
And a wise man understands
which is called for.

1159
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:44,750
- But I thought you'd like that.
- No.

1160
01:20:44,930 --> 01:20:47,720
You being expelled from school
is not daring to me, it's stupid.

1161
01:20:48,930 --> 01:20:50,760
Because you'll miss
some golden opportunities.

1162
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:52,720
Yeah, like what?

1163
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:55,980
Like if nothing else,
the opportunity to attend my classes.

1164
01:20:59,570 --> 01:21:01,350
Got it, Ace?

1165
01:21:01,950 --> 01:21:03,060
Aye, aye, captain.

1166
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:05,600
Keep your head about you.

1167
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,650
That goes for the lot of you.

1168
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:11,700
- Yes, captain.
- Yes, captain.

1169
01:21:12,330 --> 01:21:13,570
Phone call from God.

1170
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:18,210
If it had been collect,
it would have been daring.

1171
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:24,090
All right. Go on, play.

1172
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,940
We're trying to rehearse, okay?

1173
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:39,260
A good persuasion.
Therefore, hear me, Hermia.

1174
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:43,190
Wait please. Excitement.
I don't hear any excitement about this play.

1175
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,820
And take her hand.

1176
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:51,950
Bring her down the stage and stop, and,
"There, gentle Hermia." Try again.

1177
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:55,790
- What's for dinner?
- Spaghetti and meatballs.

1178
01:21:58,670 --> 01:22:01,000
Save some for me.

1179
01:22:02,630 --> 01:22:05,590
But, room, fairy! Here comes Oberon.

1180
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:11,710
- Father.
- Neil.

1181
01:22:13,730 --> 01:22:17,720
- Before you say anything, please let me...
- Don't you dare talk back to me.

1182
01:22:19,730 --> 01:22:22,270
It's bad enough
that you've wasted your time

1183
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:25,730
with this absurd acting business.

1184
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:29,020
But you deliberately deceived me.

1185
01:22:30,330 --> 01:22:32,660
How did you expect
to get away with this?

1186
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:37,120
Answer me.

1187
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:41,620
Who put you up to it? Was it
this new man, this, uh, Mr. Keating?

1188
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:44,540
No, nobody...

1189
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,420
I thought I'd surprise you.

1190
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:49,970
- I've gotten all A's in every class.
- So did you think I wasn't gonna find out?

1191
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:53,800
"Oh, my niece is in a play with your son,"
says Mrs. marks.

1192
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:55,130
"No, no, no," I say.

1193
01:22:55,310 --> 01:22:58,270
"You must be mistaken.
My son's not in a play."

1194
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,770
You made a liar out of me, Neil.

1195
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:08,690
Now, tomorrow, you go to them
and you tell them that you're quitting.

1196
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:12,490
No, I can't. I have the main part.
The performance is tomorrow night.

1197
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:16,940
I don't care if the world comes to an end
tomorrow. You are through with that play.

1198
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,830
Is that clear?

1199
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:22,490
Is that clear?

1200
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:25,080
Yes, sir.

1201
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:36,930
I made a great many sacrifices
to get you here, Neil.

1202
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,970
And you will not let me down.

1203
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,140
No, sir.

1204
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:07,460
It's open.

1205
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,310
Neil, what's up?

1206
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:22,640
- Can I speak to you a minute?
- Certainly. Sit down.

1207
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:28,390
- I'm sorry, here.
- Excuse me.

1208
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:33,910
- Get you some tea?
- Tea, sure.

1209
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:38,030
- Like some milk or sugar in that?
- No, thanks.

1210
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:40,370
Gosh, they don't give you much room
around here.

1211
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:42,280
No, it's part of the monastic oath.

1212
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:45,950
They don't want worldly things
distracting me from my teaching.

1213
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:51,590
- She's pretty.
- She's also in London.

1214
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,750
Makes it a little difficult.

1215
01:24:53,930 --> 01:24:56,170
- How can you stand it?
- Stand what?

1216
01:24:56,350 --> 01:24:58,010
You can go anywhere.
You can do anything.

1217
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:01,020
- How can you stand being here?
- Because I love teaching.

1218
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:03,390
I don't want to be anywhere else.

1219
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:08,520
What's up?

1220
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:10,900
I just talked to my father.

1221
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:13,610
He's making me quit the play
at Henley Hall.

1222
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:20,160
Acting's everything to me. I...

1223
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:22,620
But he doesn't know, he...

1224
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:25,700
I can see his point.
We're not a rich family like Charlie's.

1225
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:26,960
And we...

1226
01:25:28,050 --> 01:25:30,160
But he's planning the rest of my life
for me,

1227
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:32,630
and he's never asked me what I want.

1228
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:35,580
Have you ever told your father
what you just told me?

1229
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:38,290
About your passion for acting.
You ever show him that?

1230
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:40,880
- I can't.
- Why not?

1231
01:25:41,810 --> 01:25:46,430
- I can't talk to him this way.
- Then you're acting for him too.

1232
01:25:46,610 --> 01:25:48,520
You're playing the part of the dutiful son.

1233
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:52,270
I know this sounds impossible,
but you have to talk to him.

1234
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,400
Show him who you are,
what your heart is.

1235
01:25:54,610 --> 01:25:56,900
I know what he'll say.

1236
01:25:57,240 --> 01:26:00,280
He'll tell me that acting's a whim
and I should forget it.

1237
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:02,740
That they're counting on me.

1238
01:26:02,910 --> 01:26:05,660
He'll just tell me to put it out of my mind
for my own good.

1239
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:09,500
You are not an indentured servant.
If it's not a whim for you,

1240
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:12,250
you prove it to him
by your conviction and your passion.

1241
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:14,840
You show him that,
and if he still doesn't believe you,

1242
01:26:15,010 --> 01:26:17,970
well, by then, you'll be out of school
and you can do anything you want.

1243
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:21,600
No.

1244
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,510
What about the play?
The show's tomorrow night.

1245
01:26:26,690 --> 01:26:29,680
Then you have to talk to him
before tomorrow night.

1246
01:26:32,190 --> 01:26:33,810
I...

1247
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,440
- Isn't there an easier way?
- No.

1248
01:26:41,950 --> 01:26:43,860
I'm trapped.

1249
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:46,450
No, you're not.

1250
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:04,840
I need my notebook.

1251
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:07,590
I'll see you later, Brian.

1252
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:11,720
Chris.

1253
01:27:13,610 --> 01:27:15,020
Hey, Chris.

1254
01:27:15,190 --> 01:27:18,110
- Chris Noel, do you know where she is?
- I think she's in Room 111.

1255
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:19,900
Thanks.

1256
01:27:22,490 --> 01:27:24,280
I know.

1257
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:28,580
Oh, no.

1258
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:34,170
- Excuse me. Chris.
- Knox, what are you doing here?

1259
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:36,170
I came to apologize for the other night.

1260
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:38,290
I brought you these
and a poem I wrote for you.

1261
01:27:41,930 --> 01:27:44,590
Knox, don't you know
that if Chet finds you here, he'll kill you?

1262
01:27:44,770 --> 01:27:46,430
I don't care.

1263
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,560
- I love you, Chris.
- Knox, you're crazy.

1264
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:51,180
- Look, I acted like a jerk, and I know it.
- Hey.

1265
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:55,020
- Please accept these. Please?
- No, I... I can't.

1266
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:57,100
Just forget it.

1267
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,750
- Knox, I don't believe this.
- All I'm asking you to do is listen.

1268
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:20,210
The heavens made a girl named Chris

1269
01:28:21,890 --> 01:28:23,800
With hair and skin of gold

1270
01:28:25,010 --> 01:28:29,180
To touch her would be paradise

1271
01:28:44,490 --> 01:28:47,030
- Uhh.
- Get out of here.

1272
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,610
Cameron, you fool.

1273
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:52,500
- Hey, how'd it go? Did you read it to her?
- Yeah.

1274
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:57,410
- What'd she say?
- Nothing.

1275
01:28:57,590 --> 01:28:59,580
Nothing? What do you mean, nothing?

1276
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,920
Nothing. But I did it.

1277
01:29:03,090 --> 01:29:06,590
What did she say?
She had to say something.

1278
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:09,680
- Come here, Knox.
- Seize the day. Whoo-hoo-hoo.

1279
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:21,770
- Did you talk to your father?
- Uh, yeah.

1280
01:29:21,950 --> 01:29:23,780
He didn't like it one bit,

1281
01:29:23,950 --> 01:29:26,480
but at least he's letting me
stay in the play.

1282
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:29,740
He won't be able make it.
He's in Chicago.

1283
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:33,070
But I think he's gonna let me stay
with acting.

1284
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:37,410
Really? You told him what you told me?

1285
01:29:37,630 --> 01:29:39,580
Yeah.

1286
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:42,250
He wasn't happy.

1287
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:46,510
But he'll be gone at least four days.

1288
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,790
I don't think he'll make the show,

1289
01:29:51,310 --> 01:29:53,890
but I think he'll let me stay with it.

1290
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:55,390
Keep up the school work.

1291
01:29:59,230 --> 01:30:00,350
Thanks.

1292
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:06,650
- Baby.
- Beautiful baby.

1293
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:11,280
- Henley Hall, here I come.
- Excuse me, just a moment.

1294
01:30:11,450 --> 01:30:14,040
Yes, you.

1295
01:30:14,210 --> 01:30:15,790
Come on, Todd, I'm trying to fix this.

1296
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:18,200
Come on, Nuwanda,
we're gonna miss Neil's entrance.

1297
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:20,740
He said something about getting red
before we left.

1298
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:22,960
Getting red? What does that mean?

1299
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:26,000
I... Well, you know Charlie.

1300
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:31,010
So, Charlie, what's this "getting red" bit?

1301
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:38,010
What is that?

1302
01:30:38,190 --> 01:30:40,980
It's an Indian warrior symbol for virility.

1303
01:30:41,150 --> 01:30:44,640
Makes me feel potent.
Like it can drive girls crazy.

1304
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:47,110
Oh, come on, Charlie.
The girls are waiting.

1305
01:30:48,070 --> 01:30:50,690
- Henley Hall.
- Whoa.

1306
01:30:56,870 --> 01:30:58,530
Chris.

1307
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:03,830
- What are you doing here?
- Gentlemen, let's go.

1308
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:07,620
- Go ahead, guys, I'll catch up.
- Yeah, come on, guys.

1309
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:09,920
Chris, you can't be in here.

1310
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:12,010
If they catch you,
we're gonna be in trouble.

1311
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:13,470
- Come on.
- Oh, but it's fine...

1312
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,010
Chris.

1313
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:20,800
It's fine for you to come into my school
and make a complete fool out of me?

1314
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:24,440
- I didn't mean to make a fool out of you.
- Well, you did.

1315
01:31:24,610 --> 01:31:26,600
Chet found out,
and it took everything I could do

1316
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:29,320
to keep him from coming here
and killing you.

1317
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:31,700
Knox, you have got to stop this stuff.

1318
01:31:31,870 --> 01:31:33,950
I can't, Chris. I love you.

1319
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:37,240
Knox, you say that over and over.

1320
01:31:37,410 --> 01:31:39,780
You don't even know me.

1321
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,910
Will you be joining us, Mr. Overstreet?

1322
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:43,500
Go ahead, captain. I'll walk.

1323
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:50,420
Knox. Knox, if it just so happens
that I could care less about you...

1324
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:56,170
Then you wouldn't be here
warning me about Chet.

1325
01:32:00,690 --> 01:32:03,390
I have to go.
I'm gonna be late for the play.

1326
01:32:03,570 --> 01:32:07,680
- Are you going with him?
- Chet, to a play? Are you kidding?

1327
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:10,350
- Then come with me.
- Knox, you are so infuriating.

1328
01:32:10,530 --> 01:32:13,110
Come on, Chris,
just give me one chance.

1329
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,900
If you don't like me after tonight,
I'll stay away forever.

1330
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:19,450
- Uh-huh.
- I promise. Dead Poets' honor.

1331
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:20,700
You come with me tonight,

1332
01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:23,330
then if you don't want to see me again,
I swear, I'll bow out.

1333
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:26,030
You know what would happen
if Chet found out?

1334
01:32:26,210 --> 01:32:27,830
He won't know anything.

1335
01:32:28,010 --> 01:32:31,000
We'll sit in the back and sneak away
as soon as it's over.

1336
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:34,840
And I suppose you would promise
that this would be the end of it.

1337
01:32:35,010 --> 01:32:36,250
Dead Poets' honor.

1338
01:32:36,810 --> 01:32:38,010
What is that?

1339
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:41,550
My word.

1340
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:57,070
You are so infuriating.

1341
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:20,880
- Hey, there he is.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1342
01:33:21,690 --> 01:33:23,520
Shh. Boys.

1343
01:33:30,610 --> 01:33:34,850
Either I mistake your shape
or making quite,

1344
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:39,120
Or else you are that shrewd
and knavish sprite

1345
01:33:39,290 --> 01:33:40,530
Called Robin Goodfellow.

1346
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:44,490
Thou speak'st aright;
I am that merry wanderer of the night.

1347
01:33:44,670 --> 01:33:47,410
I jest to Oberon and make him smile

1348
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:51,250
When I a fat
and bean-fed horse, pbbt, beguile,

1349
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:54,420
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal.

1350
01:33:54,630 --> 01:33:59,920
Sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,
In very likeness of a roasted crab,

1351
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:02,890
And when she drink,
against her lips I bob

1352
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:05,640
And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.

1353
01:34:05,850 --> 01:34:07,810
He's good. He's really good.

1354
01:34:08,690 --> 01:34:11,520
Sometime for three-foot stool
mistaketh me;

1355
01:34:11,690 --> 01:34:14,310
Then slip I from her bum,
down topples she,

1356
01:34:14,490 --> 01:34:17,100
And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;

1357
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:20,150
And then the whole quire
hold their hips and laugh,

1358
01:34:20,330 --> 01:34:24,700
And waxen in their mirth
and neeze and swear

1359
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:27,950
A merrier hour was never wasted there.

1360
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:31,370
But, room, fairy! Here comes Oberon.

1361
01:34:31,550 --> 01:34:34,580
And here my mistress.
Would that he were gone!

1362
01:34:38,850 --> 01:34:41,590
Then by your side
no bed-room me deny;

1363
01:34:41,810 --> 01:34:44,670
For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.

1364
01:34:44,890 --> 01:34:47,510
Lysander riddles very prettily:

1365
01:34:47,690 --> 01:34:49,430
Now much beshrew
my manners and my pride,

1366
01:34:49,610 --> 01:34:52,140
If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.

1367
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:55,150
But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy

1368
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:57,690
Lie further off; In human modesty,

1369
01:34:57,860 --> 01:35:01,820
Such separation as many well be said
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,

1370
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:03,820
and, good night, sweet friend:

1371
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,200
Thy love ne'er alter
till thy sweet life end!

1372
01:35:06,370 --> 01:35:10,120
Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;

1373
01:35:10,290 --> 01:35:12,410
Neil. That's your cue, Neil.

1374
01:35:12,590 --> 01:35:15,700
Come on, Neil.
Here's your crown. Let's go.

1375
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:24,160
If we shadows have offended,

1376
01:36:25,950 --> 01:36:28,360
Think but this, and all is mended,

1377
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:32,160
That you have but slumber'd here
While these visions did appear.

1378
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:36,540
And this weak and idle theme,
No more yielding but a dream,

1379
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:43,760
Gentles, do not reprehend:
If you pardon, we will mend:

1380
01:36:43,930 --> 01:36:47,420
And, as I am an honest Puck,
If we have unearned luck

1381
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:52,430
Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
We will make amends ere long;

1382
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:54,480
Else the Puck a liar call;

1383
01:36:58,530 --> 01:37:02,610
So, good night unto you all.
Give me your hands, if we be friends,

1384
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:06,230
And Robin shall restore amends.

1385
01:37:39,690 --> 01:37:41,480
Yeah!

1386
01:37:41,690 --> 01:37:43,400
Yeah, Neil.

1387
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:56,460
Great job, Neil.

1388
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:58,910
Great show, everyone.

1389
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:08,880
Excuse me, I'm Neil's father.
I need to see him.

1390
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:16,310
Your father, he's...

1391
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:18,600
What did you think of it?

1392
01:38:18,770 --> 01:38:23,560
Really, I thought
you were all just wonderful.

1393
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:38,870
Excuse me, please. Excuse me.

1394
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:42,380
- Excuse me, please.
- Neil. Neil.

1395
01:38:43,010 --> 01:38:45,340
- Neil.
- We love you, wait.

1396
01:38:45,930 --> 01:38:47,510
- I can't, guys.
- Neil.

1397
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:49,880
- Neil.
- Excuse me.

1398
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,890
Neil. Neil. You have the gift.

1399
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:57,090
What a performance.
You left even me speechless.

1400
01:38:57,270 --> 01:38:58,760
- You have to stay...
- Get in the car.

1401
01:38:58,940 --> 01:39:02,060
Keating, you stay away from my son.

1402
01:39:02,570 --> 01:39:06,940
Neil. Neil. Mr. Perry, come on.

1403
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:09,350
Don't make it any worse than it is.

1404
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:23,990
Is it okay if we walk back?

1405
01:39:24,670 --> 01:39:26,210
Captain?

1406
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:31,550
Knox.

1407
01:39:32,430 --> 01:39:36,300
- We'll be home about 11:30 still.
- I know where he gets it.

1408
01:40:12,890 --> 01:40:19,300
Ahem. We're trying very hard to understand
why it is that you insist on defying us.

1409
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:25,600
Whatever the reason,
we're not gonna let you ruin your life.

1410
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:27,430
Tomorrow I'm withdrawing you
from Welton

1411
01:40:27,610 --> 01:40:29,400
and enrolling you
in Braden Military School.

1412
01:40:29,990 --> 01:40:32,600
You're going to Harvard
and you're gonna be a doctor.

1413
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:37,940
But that's 10 more years.

1414
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:40,200
- Father, that's a lifetime.
- Oh, stop it.

1415
01:40:40,370 --> 01:40:43,990
Don't be so dramatic.
You make it sound like a prison term.

1416
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:47,540
You don't understand, Neil.

1417
01:40:47,710 --> 01:40:49,830
You have opportunities
that I never even dreamt of.

1418
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:53,250
- I am not going to let you waste them.
- I've got to tell you what I feel.

1419
01:40:53,430 --> 01:40:56,640
- We've been so worried about...
- What? What? Tell me what you feel.

1420
01:40:59,140 --> 01:41:00,550
What is it?

1421
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:12,770
Is it more of this...?
This acting business?

1422
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:15,730
Because you can forget that.

1423
01:41:17,830 --> 01:41:19,160
What?

1424
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:25,830
Nothing.

1425
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:41,300
Nothing?

1426
01:41:45,230 --> 01:41:46,840
Well, then, let's go to bed.

1427
01:42:00,450 --> 01:42:02,320
I was good.

1428
01:42:03,290 --> 01:42:05,330
I was really good.

1429
01:42:10,340 --> 01:42:12,550
Go on, get some sleep.

1430
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:48,410
It's all right. It's going to be all right.

1431
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:05,820
- What was that?
- What?

1432
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:10,900
- That sound.
- What sound?

1433
01:46:17,710 --> 01:46:19,250
Tom?

1434
01:46:23,380 --> 01:46:25,120
What is it?

1435
01:46:26,970 --> 01:46:28,710
What's wrong?

1436
01:46:38,730 --> 01:46:40,560
Neil?

1437
01:46:47,370 --> 01:46:49,280
Tom, what is it?

1438
01:46:50,410 --> 01:46:52,240
What's wrong?

1439
01:46:55,540 --> 01:46:56,620
Neil?

1440
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:04,790
- Neil?
- I'll look outside.

1441
01:47:06,510 --> 01:47:07,720
Neil?

1442
01:47:25,950 --> 01:47:29,940
No!

1443
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:31,570
Oh, Neil!

1444
01:47:31,740 --> 01:47:34,150
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

1445
01:47:34,330 --> 01:47:38,070
- No, no, no. He's all right.
- Oh, my son. My son, my poor son.

1446
01:47:38,250 --> 01:47:42,370
- He's all right. He's all right. He's all right.
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

1447
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:45,500
Stop it.

1448
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:54,050
Todd?

1449
01:47:54,890 --> 01:47:58,510
- Todd.
- Oh, Charlie.

1450
01:48:05,740 --> 01:48:07,320
What is it?

1451
01:48:16,540 --> 01:48:18,700
Neil's dead.

1452
01:48:56,950 --> 01:48:58,030
It's so beautiful.

1453
01:49:11,010 --> 01:49:13,370
Todd. It's okay, Todd.

1454
01:49:13,550 --> 01:49:15,010
- Calm down.
- It's all right, Todd.

1455
01:49:16,390 --> 01:49:17,970
Todd, it's okay. It's okay, Todd.

1456
01:49:18,140 --> 01:49:19,970
It's all right.

1457
01:49:20,140 --> 01:49:21,880
- Now, listen.
- He wouldn't have done it.

1458
01:49:22,060 --> 01:49:23,850
- You can't explain it.
- It was his father.

1459
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:26,680
- No.
- He wouldn't have left us.

1460
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:30,070
He wouldn't have. His dad was...

1461
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:31,650
- Todd.
- His father did it.

1462
01:49:31,820 --> 01:49:34,810
- His father killed him.
- You can't explain it, Todd.

1463
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:39,950
- Todd.
- Leave him be.

1464
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:45,030
Neil!

1465
01:52:19,410 --> 01:52:21,690
The death of Neil Perry is a tragedy.

1466
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:28,070
He was a fine student.

1467
01:52:29,370 --> 01:52:31,740
One of Welton's best.

1468
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:35,790
And he will be missed.

1469
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:44,250
We've contacted each of your parents
to explain the situation.

1470
01:52:44,430 --> 01:52:47,170
Naturally, they're all quite concerned.

1471
01:52:53,150 --> 01:52:56,140
At the request of Neil's family,

1472
01:52:56,940 --> 01:53:01,610
I intend to conduct a thorough enquiry
into this matter.

1473
01:53:03,620 --> 01:53:07,320
Your complete cooperation is expected.

1474
01:53:17,630 --> 01:53:19,870
- You told him about this meeting?
- Twice.

1475
01:53:20,050 --> 01:53:22,290
That's it, guys. We're all fried.

1476
01:53:22,470 --> 01:53:25,080
- How do you mean?
- Cameron's a fink.

1477
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:28,380
- He's in Nolan's office right now, finking.
- About what?

1478
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:31,680
The club, Pittsie. Think about it.

1479
01:53:31,850 --> 01:53:35,560
The board of directors,
the trustees and Mr. Nolan.

1480
01:53:35,730 --> 01:53:39,350
Do you think for one moment
they're gonna let this thing just blow over?

1481
01:53:39,530 --> 01:53:42,440
Schools go down
because of things like this.

1482
01:53:42,610 --> 01:53:43,820
They need a scapegoat.

1483
01:54:00,010 --> 01:54:01,290
What's going on, guys?

1484
01:54:03,010 --> 01:54:04,920
You finked, didn't you, Cameron?

1485
01:54:05,260 --> 01:54:07,170
Finked? I don't know
what you're talking about.

1486
01:54:07,350 --> 01:54:10,090
You told Nolan everything about the club
is what I'm talking about.

1487
01:54:10,270 --> 01:54:11,880
Look, in case you hadn't heard, Dalton,

1488
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:15,600
there's something called an honor code
at this school, all right?

1489
01:54:15,770 --> 01:54:18,810
If a teacher asks you a question,
you tell the truth or you're expelled.

1490
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:20,560
- You little punk.
- Charlie.

1491
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:24,730
He's a rat! He's in it up to his eyes,
so he ratted to save himself.

1492
01:54:24,910 --> 01:54:26,520
Don't touch him. You do and you're out.

1493
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:28,690
- I'm out anyway.
- You don't know that, not yet.

1494
01:54:28,870 --> 01:54:30,860
He's right there, Charlie.

1495
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:34,780
And if you guys are smart, you will do
exactly what I did and cooperate.

1496
01:54:35,870 --> 01:54:39,710
They're not after us. We're the victims.

1497
01:54:41,130 --> 01:54:42,460
Us and Neil.

1498
01:54:42,670 --> 01:54:44,880
What's that mean? Who are they after?

1499
01:54:45,090 --> 01:54:48,330
Why, Mr. Keating, of course.
The "captain" himself.

1500
01:54:49,300 --> 01:54:52,420
I mean, you guys didn't really think
he could avoid responsibility, did you?

1501
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:54,720
Mr. Keating responsible for Neil?

1502
01:54:54,890 --> 01:54:58,180
- Is that what they're saying?
- Well, who else do you think, dumb-ass?

1503
01:54:58,360 --> 01:55:01,060
The administration? Mr. Perry?

1504
01:55:01,230 --> 01:55:03,650
Mr. Keating put us up to all this crap,
didn't he?

1505
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:07,860
If it wasn't for Mr. Keating, Neil would be
cozied up in his room right now

1506
01:55:08,030 --> 01:55:09,860
studying his chemistry
and dreaming of being...

1507
01:55:10,030 --> 01:55:12,070
That is not true, Cameron.
You know that.

1508
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:15,160
He didn't put us up to anything.
Neil loved acting.

1509
01:55:15,330 --> 01:55:18,870
Believe what you want,
but I say let Keating fry.

1510
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:22,120
I mean, why ruin our lives?

1511
01:55:23,380 --> 01:55:24,960
Charlie.

1512
01:55:25,170 --> 01:55:26,510
- You dummy.
- Charlie.

1513
01:55:32,220 --> 01:55:35,180
You just signed your expulsion papers,
Nuwanda.

1514
01:55:39,020 --> 01:55:42,260
And if the rest of you are smart,
you'll do exactly what I did.

1515
01:55:43,940 --> 01:55:46,600
They know everything anyway.

1516
01:55:48,860 --> 01:55:51,320
You can't save Keating,

1517
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:54,150
but you can save yourselves.

1518
01:56:27,610 --> 01:56:30,150
Knox Overstreet.

1519
01:56:56,930 --> 01:56:59,420
- Meeks.
- Go away, I have to study.

1520
01:57:01,730 --> 01:57:05,600
- What happened to Nuwanda?
- Expelled.

1521
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:10,060
What'd you tell them?

1522
01:57:10,740 --> 01:57:13,230
Nothing they didn't already know.

1523
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:17,240
Todd Anderson.

1524
01:57:38,930 --> 01:57:41,420
- Hello, son.
- Hello, darling.

1525
01:57:43,650 --> 01:57:45,260
Mom.

1526
01:57:51,150 --> 01:57:53,270
Have a seat, Mr. Anderson.

1527
01:57:59,490 --> 01:58:02,950
Mr. Anderson, I think we've pretty well
put together what's happened here.

1528
01:58:03,120 --> 01:58:08,290
You do admit to being a part
of this Dead Poets Society?

1529
01:58:11,210 --> 01:58:13,300
Answer him, Todd.

1530
01:58:15,590 --> 01:58:17,080
Yes, sir.

1531
01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:24,470
I have here a detailed description
of what occurred at your meetings.

1532
01:58:24,650 --> 01:58:26,390
It describes how your teacher,
Mr. Keating,

1533
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:28,980
encouraged you boys
to organize this club

1534
01:58:29,150 --> 01:58:34,390
and to use it as a source of inspiration
for reckless and self-indulgent behavior.

1535
01:58:34,570 --> 01:58:38,810
It describes how Mr. Keating,
both in and out of the classroom,

1536
01:58:38,990 --> 01:58:43,110
encouraged Neil Perry
to follow his obsession with acting

1537
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:48,950
when he knew all along it was against
the explicit orders of Neil's parents.

1538
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:52,960
It was Mr. Keating's blatant abuse
of his position as teacher

1539
01:58:53,170 --> 01:58:56,210
that led directly to Neil Perry's death.

1540
01:59:06,770 --> 01:59:08,980
Read that document carefully, Todd.

1541
01:59:11,270 --> 01:59:13,360
Very carefully.

1542
01:59:19,370 --> 01:59:22,110
If you've nothing to add or amend,
sign it.

1543
01:59:23,450 --> 01:59:25,740
What's gonna happen to Mr. Keating?

1544
01:59:25,910 --> 01:59:30,080
I've had enough. Sign the paper, Todd.

1545
01:59:34,460 --> 01:59:38,380
McAllister: Grass is garment or herbal.

1546
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:41,130
Lapis is stone.

1547
01:59:41,300 --> 01:59:45,170
The entire building is aedificium.

1548
02:00:21,470 --> 02:00:22,930
Sit.

1549
02:00:24,770 --> 02:00:27,010
I'll be teaching this class
through exams.

1550
02:00:27,180 --> 02:00:30,390
We'll find a permanent English teacher
during the break.

1551
02:00:32,650 --> 02:00:35,760
Who will tell me where you are
in the Pritchard textbook?

1552
02:00:42,410 --> 02:00:44,070
Mr. Anderson.

1553
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:49,160
- In the... In the Pr...
- I can't hear you, Mr. Anderson.

1554
02:00:49,330 --> 02:00:51,620
In the Pritchard?

1555
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:53,910
Kindly inform me, Mr. Cameron.

1556
02:00:55,750 --> 02:00:58,420
We skipped around a lot, sir.
We covered the romantics

1557
02:00:58,590 --> 02:01:01,300
and some of the chapters
on post Civil War literature.

1558
02:01:01,970 --> 02:01:03,210
What about the realists?

1559
02:01:04,260 --> 02:01:06,750
I believe we skipped most of that, sir.

1560
02:01:07,970 --> 02:01:09,640
All right, then, we'll start over.

1561
02:01:13,100 --> 02:01:15,060
What is poetry?

1562
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:20,900
Come.

1563
02:01:23,780 --> 02:01:25,360
Excuse me.

1564
02:01:27,660 --> 02:01:30,280
I came for my personals.

1565
02:01:30,750 --> 02:01:34,370
- Should I come back after class?
- Get them now, Mr. Keating.

1566
02:01:37,670 --> 02:01:40,710
Gentlemen, turn to page 21
of the introduction.

1567
02:01:42,260 --> 02:01:43,470
Mr. Cameron,

1568
02:01:44,590 --> 02:01:48,880
read aloud the excellent essay
by Dr. Pritchard

1569
02:01:49,060 --> 02:01:51,420
on "Understanding Poetry."

1570
02:01:53,560 --> 02:01:55,300
That page has been ripped out, sir.

1571
02:01:56,190 --> 02:01:59,770
- Well, borrow somebody else's book.
- They're all ripped out, sir.

1572
02:01:59,990 --> 02:02:01,900
What do you mean,
they're all ripped out?

1573
02:02:03,700 --> 02:02:06,730
- Sir, we...
- Never mind.

1574
02:02:11,410 --> 02:02:13,070
Read.

1575
02:02:15,710 --> 02:02:20,000
"Understanding Poetry,
by Dr. J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D."

1576
02:02:20,170 --> 02:02:21,330
To fully understand poetry,

1577
02:02:21,510 --> 02:02:25,170
we must first be fluent with its meter,
rhyme and figures of speech,

1578
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:26,630
then ask two questions.

1579
02:02:27,300 --> 02:02:30,300
One: How artfully has the objective
of the poem been rendered?

1580
02:02:30,520 --> 02:02:32,130
And two:

1581
02:02:33,690 --> 02:02:36,640
How important is that objective?

1582
02:02:36,810 --> 02:02:40,520
Question one rates the poem's perfection.
Question two rates its importance.

1583
02:02:40,690 --> 02:02:42,480
And once these questions
have been answered,

1584
02:02:42,650 --> 02:02:45,610
determining the poem's greatness
becomes a relatively simple matter.

1585
02:02:45,780 --> 02:02:48,940
"If the poem's score for perfection
is plotted on the horizontal of a graph..."

1586
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:51,280
- Mr. Keating, they made everybody sign it.
- Quiet.

1587
02:02:51,450 --> 02:02:52,780
You gotta believe me, it's true.

1588
02:02:52,950 --> 02:02:54,950
- I do believe you, Todd.
- Leave, Mr. Keating.

1589
02:02:55,120 --> 02:02:56,860
- But it wasn't his fault.
- Sit down.

1590
02:02:57,080 --> 02:02:59,200
One more outburst from you
or anyone else,

1591
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:01,660
and you're out of this school.

1592
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:03,870
Leave, Mr. Keating.

1593
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:08,500
I said leave, Mr. Keating.

1594
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:25,400
O Captain! My Captain!

1595
02:03:25,610 --> 02:03:28,480
Sit down, Mr. Anderson.

1596
02:03:30,280 --> 02:03:32,650
Do you hear me? Sit down.

1597
02:03:33,370 --> 02:03:35,450
Sit down.

1598
02:03:37,330 --> 02:03:40,370
This is your final warning, Anderson.

1599
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,040
How dare you?

1600
02:03:43,210 --> 02:03:45,550
Do you hear me?

1601
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:47,420
O Captain! My Captain!

1602
02:03:49,050 --> 02:03:52,640
Mr. Overstreet, I warn you. Sit down.

1603
02:03:55,270 --> 02:03:57,050
Sit down.

1604
02:03:57,270 --> 02:03:58,930
Sit down. All of you.

1605
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:02,350
I want you seated. Sit down.

1606
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:03,930
Leave, Mr. Keating.

1607
02:04:12,450 --> 02:04:14,940
All of you, down. I want you seated.

1608
02:04:15,620 --> 02:04:17,660
Do you hear me?

1609
02:04:23,460 --> 02:04:25,700
Sit down.

1610
02:05:06,170 --> 02:05:08,000
Thank you, boys.

1611
02:05:10,050 --> 02:05:11,460
Thank you.

1612
02:05:12,275 --> 02:05:20,275
