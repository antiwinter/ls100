MAN:
<i>Mr. Dufresne, describe...</i>

22
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:11,048
...the confrontation you had with
your wife the night she was murdered.

23
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,387
It was very bitter.

24
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:22,059
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around.

25
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,064
And she said that she wanted
a divorce in Reno.

26
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,984
- What was your response?
- I told her I would not grant one.

27
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:34,363
"I'll see you in hell
before I see you in Reno."

28
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,908

according to your neighbors.

30
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,622

31
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,333
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

32
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,252
She packed a bag.

33
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,590
She packed a bag to go
and stay with Mr. Quentin.

34
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:58,345
D.A.: <i>Glenn Quentin, golf pro
at the Snowden Hills Country Club...</i>

35
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,682
<i>...whom you had discovered
was your wife's lover.</i>

36
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,185
Did you follow her?

37
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,605
I went to a few bars first.

38
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:13,193
Later, I drove to his house
to confront them. They weren't home.

39
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,278
I parked in the turnout...

40
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:16,988

41

43
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,495

46
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,960
<i>...mostly I wanted to scare them.</i>

47
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,505
When they arrived, you went up
to the house and murdered them.

48
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,799
ANDY:
No, I was sobering up.

49
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,678
I got back in the car
and I drove home to sleep it off.

50
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,848
Along the way, I threw my gun
into the Royal River.

51
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,142
I've been very clear on this point.

52
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:49,354
I get hazy where the cleaning woman
shows up the following morning...

53
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,149
...and finds your wife in bed
with her lover...

54
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,484
...riddled with .38-caliber bullets.

55
00:03:55,819 --> 00:04:00,031
Does that strike you as a
fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

56
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:01,950
Yes, it does.

57
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,328
Yet you still maintain
you threw your gun into the river...

58
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,581
...before the murders took place.

59
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,000
That's very convenient.

60
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,877
It's the truth.

61
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:16,840
D.A.: The police dragged that river for
three days, and nary a gun was found...

62
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:21,136
...so no comparison could be made
between your gun and the bullets...

63
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,765
...taken from the bloodstained corpses
of the victims.

64
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,851
And that also...

65
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,730
...is very convenient.
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

66
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,150
Since I am innocent of this crime...

67
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:39,988
...I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

To tell you the truth,
I haven't made up my mind.

341
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:35,200
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

342
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,455
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time.

343
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,623
I wonder if you might get me
a rock hammer.

344
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,251
- A what?
- A rock hammer.

345
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,296
- What is it and why?
- What do you care?

346
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,341
Well, if it was a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask.
I'd quote a price.

347
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,969
But then a toothbrush
is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

348
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,972
Fair enough.

349
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,017
A rock hammer is about
six or seven inches long.

350
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,561
- Looks like a miniature pickax.
- Pickax?

351
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,980
- For rocks.
- Rocks.

352
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,816
Quartz?

353
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,402

00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:15,199

356
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,078
So?

357
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,830
So I'm a rock hound.

358
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,375
At least I was in my old life.

Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.

01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:23,201
Perhaps you should try a new profession.

1186
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:26,204
What I mean is...

1187
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:29,499
...you're not a very good thief.
You should try something else.

1188
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:33,420
Yeah, what the hell
you know about it, Capone?

1189
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:35,422
What are you in for?

1190
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:36,715
Me?

1191
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:40,802
A lawyer fucked me.

1192
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:47,684
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

1193
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:59,988
RED: <i>As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.</i>

1194
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:02,699
<i>Maybe he thought of them
on the streets...</i>

1195
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:05,410
<i>...or his child growing up
not knowing her daddy.</i>

1196
01:26:05,702 --> 01:26:07,079
<i>Whatever it was...</i>

1197
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:09,831
<i>...something lit a fire
under that boy's ass.</i>

1198
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:16,546
Thought I might try for
my high school equivalency.

1199
01:26:16,755 --> 01:26:19,257
Hear you helped
a couple of fellas with that.

1200
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:22,844
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.

1201
01:26:24,262 --> 01:26:26,765
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1202
01:26:28,475 --> 01:26:30,310
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1203
01:26:31,978 --> 01:26:33,438
You really mean that?

1204
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:35,816
Yes, sir, I do.

1205
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:37,984
Good. Because if we do this...

1206
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:42,155
...we do it all the way,
a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.

1207
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:44,199
Thing is, see...

1208
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:46,993
...I don't read so good.

1209
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:49,287
"Well."

1210
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:52,999
You don't read...

1211
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:54,793
...so well.

1212
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:58,630
We'll get to that.

1213
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:05,178
RED:
<i>So Andy took Tommy under his wing.</i>

1214
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:08,014
<i>Started walking him through his ABC's.</i>

1215
01:27:10,142 --> 01:27:12,352
<i>Tommy took to it pretty well too.</i>

1216
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:15,397
<i>Boy found brains he never knew he had.</i>

1217
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:21,153
<i>Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.</i>

1218
01:27:21,361 --> 01:27:23,029
<i>He really liked the kid.</i>

1219
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:26,825
<i>Gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.</i>

1220
01:27:27,325 --> 01:27:29,578
<i>But that wasn't the only reason.</i>

1221
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:32,497
<i>Prison time is slow time.</i>

1222
01:27:32,956 --> 01:27:35,542

1224
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:40,839
<i>Others build matchstick houses.</i>

1225
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:44,092
<i>Andy built a library.</i>

1226
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:46,511
<i>Now he needed a new project.</i>

1227
01:27:47,387 --> 01:27:48,889
<i>Tommy was it.</i>

1228
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:53,518
<i>It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.</i>

1229
01:27:54,060 --> 01:27:57,314
<i>The same reason he hung
his fantasy girlies on the wall.</i>

1230

<i>In prison...</i>

1231
01:27:59,733 --> 01:28:03,487
<i>...a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.</i>

1232
01:28:04,237 --> 01:28:09,117
<i>By 1966, right about the time Tommy
was getting ready to take his exams...</i>

1233
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:11,536

[CLOCK TICKING]

1235
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:29,095
Time.

1236
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:36,394
Well?

1237
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:39,898
Well, it's for shit.

1238
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:43,235
I wasted a whole year
of my time with this bullshit.

1239
01:28:43,401 --> 01:28:44,903
It's probably not that bad.

1240
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:49,366
Yeah, I didn't get a thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1241
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:51,284
Let's see how the score comes out.

1242
01:28:51,493 --> 01:28:54,454
Yeah, well, I'll tell you
how the goddamn score comes out.

1243
01:28:56,414 --> 01:28:57,749
Two points, right there!

1244
01:28:57,958 --> 01:28:59,543
There's your goddamn score!

1245
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:03,463
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5 times 5 is 25...

1246
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:06,049
Fuck this place!

1247
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:07,425
Fuck it!

1248
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:27,821
I feel bad.

1249
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:29,239
I let him down.

1250
01:29:29,447 --> 01:29:31,157
That's crap, kid.

1251
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:32,701
He's proud of you.

1252
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:35,912
We're old friends,
I know him as good as anybody.

1253
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:37,664
Smart fellow, ain't he?

1254
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:41,001
Smart as they come.
He was a banker on the outside.

1255
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,461
What's he in here for anyway?

1256
01:29:43,753 --> 01:29:44,754
Murder.

1257
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:49,009
- The hell, you say.
- Hmm.

1258
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:52,053
You wouldn't think it
to look at the guy.

1259
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:57,392
Caught his wife in bed
with some golf pro. Greased them both.

1260
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,776
What?

1261
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:10,322
About four years ago...

1262
01:30:10,572 --> 01:30:13,825
...I was in Thomaston
on a two-to-three stretch.

1263
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:15,619
I stole a car.

1264
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:17,996
It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1265
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:20,874
About six months left to go...

1266
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:23,084
...I get a new cellmate in.

1267
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:25,420
Elmo Blatch.

1268
01:30:26,129 --> 01:30:27,464
Big, twitchy fucker.

1269
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:31,843
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.
You know what I'm saying?

1270
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:34,763
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1271
01:30:35,013 --> 01:30:37,307
Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.

1272
01:30:37,515 --> 01:30:42,437
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.
You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.

1273
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:48,151
Talked all the time too.
That's the other thing. He never shut up.

1274
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,986
Places he'd been in...

1275
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:53,365
...jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.

1276
01:30:53,573 --> 01:30:55,784
Even people he killed.

1277
01:30:57,035 --> 01:30:59,829
People who "gave him shit."

1278
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:02,040
That's how he put it.

1279
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:06,711
So one night, like a joke...

1280
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:11,299
...I say to him,
"Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?"

1281
01:31:11,549 --> 01:31:12,676
So he says:

1282
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:16,805
I got me this job one time,
busing tables at a country club...

1283
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:21,393
...so I could case all these big
rich pricks that come in.

1284
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:25,480
So I pick out this guy...

1285
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:27,941
...go in one night...

1286
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:29,901
...and do his place.

1287
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:32,654
He wakes up...

1288
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:35,156
...and gives me shit.

1289
01:31:36,241 --> 01:31:37,909
So I killed him.

1290
01:31:39,661 --> 01:31:42,497
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1291
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:46,167
And that's the best part.

1292
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:49,295
She's fucking this prick, see...

1293
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:52,590
...this golf pro,
but she's married to some other guy.

1294
01:31:53,174 --> 01:31:55,760
Some hotshot banker.

1295
01:31:57,178 --> 01:31:59,681
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1296
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:15,030
I have to say that's
the most amazing story I ever heard.

1297
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:18,783
What amazes me most
is you'd be taken in by it.

1298
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:20,535
Sir?

1299
01:32:21,453 --> 01:32:26,332
Well, it's obvious this fellow Williams
is impressed with you.

1300
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:30,879
He hears your tale of woe
and naturally wants to cheer you up.

1301
01:32:31,087 --> 01:32:33,256
He's young, not terribly bright.

1302
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:37,218
It's not surprising he wouldn't
know what a state he put you in.

1303
01:32:37,635 --> 01:32:39,179
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1304
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:44,142
Well, let's say for the moment
this Blatch does exist.

1305
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:49,022
You think he'd just fall to his knees
and cry, "Yes, I did it. I confess.

1306
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:51,941
Oh, and by the way,
add a life term to my sentence."

1307
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:55,028
With Tommy's testimony,
I can get a new trial.

1308
01:32:55,153 --> 01:32:57,614
That's assuming Blatch is even still there.

1309
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:59,783
Chances are, he'd be released by now.

1310
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:04,579
They'd have his last known address,
names of relatives. It's a chance, isn't it?

1311
01:33:06,915 --> 01:33:08,666
How can you be so obtuse?

1312
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:10,835
What?

1313
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:13,546
What did you call me?

1314
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:15,507
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1315
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,342
You're forgetting yourself.

1316
01:33:17,675 --> 01:33:20,637
The country club
will have his old time cards.

1317
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:23,598
Records, W-2s with his name on them.

1318
01:33:23,807 --> 01:33:26,518
If you want to indulge this fantasy,
it's your business.

1319
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:29,312
Don't make it mine.
This meeting is over.

1320
01:33:29,521 --> 01:33:32,107
Sir, if I got out, I'd never mention
what happens here.

1321
01:33:32,732 --> 01:33:35,693
I'd be as indictable as you
for laundering that money.

1322
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:40,532
Don't ever mention money to me again,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1323
01:33:40,698 --> 01:33:42,367
Not in this office...

1324
01:33:42,575 --> 01:33:44,536
...not anywhere. Get in here, now!

1325
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:47,455
I just wanted to put you at ease,
that's all.

1326
01:33:48,081 --> 01:33:50,208
- Solitary. A month.
- Yes, sir.

1327
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:53,169
- What's the matter with you?
- Get him out of here.

1328
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:56,923
This is my chance to get out!
It's my life! Don't you understand?!

1329
01:33:57,132 --> 01:33:59,217
Get him out!

1330
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:02,929
A month in the hole.

1331
01:34:03,138 --> 01:34:05,849
That's the longest stretch
I ever heard of.

1332
01:34:06,057 --> 01:34:07,350
TOMMY:
It's all my fault.

1333
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:09,144
Oh, bullshit.

1334
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:12,522
You didn't pull the trigger
or convict him.

1335
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:15,108
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

1336
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:17,360
I mean, for real innocent?

1337
01:34:17,569 --> 01:34:18,903
It looks that way.

1338
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:21,239
Sweet Jesus.

1339
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:23,324
How long has he been here now?

1340
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:26,995
1947. What is that? Nineteen years.

1341
01:34:27,245 --> 01:34:29,831
MAN: Williams, Thomas.
TOMMY: Yeah, over here.

1342
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:36,838

1344
01:34:39,007 --> 01:34:40,550
That son of a bitch mailed it.

1345
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:44,721
You going to open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1346
01:34:44,929 --> 01:34:47,098
Thumb up my butt sounds better.

1347
01:34:47,599 --> 01:34:50,435
Hey, Skeet, come on.
Give me that, you shithead.

1348
01:34:51,269 --> 01:34:52,604
Floyd, come on.

1349
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:56,941
Hey, Red.

1350
01:34:58,026 --> 01:35:00,445
Will you throw that away, please?

1351
01:35:06,034 --> 01:35:07,785
Well, shit.

The kid passed. C-plus average.

1354
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:25,553
Thought you'd like to know.

1355
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:43,238
Warden wants to talk.

1356
01:35:57,001 --> 01:35:58,044
TOMMY:
Out here?

1357
01:35:58,253 --> 01:36:00,505
That's what the man said.

1358
01:36:16,604 --> 01:36:20,066
TOMMY: Warden?
NORTON: Tommy?

1359
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:31,703
Tommy, I'm asking you to keep
this conversation just between us.

1360
01:36:33,204 --> 01:36:35,456
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1361
01:36:53,891 --> 01:36:55,977
We got a situation here.

1362
01:36:56,853 --> 01:36:58,938
I think you can appreciate that.

1363
01:36:59,147 --> 01:37:00,398
Yes, sir.

1364
01:37:00,648 --> 01:37:02,066
I sure can.

1365
01:37:02,317 --> 01:37:06,362
I tell you, son, this thing really
came along and knocked my wind out.

1366
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:10,408
It's got me up nights. That's the truth.

1367
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:14,495
The right thing to do...

1368
01:37:16,164 --> 01:37:19,917
...sometimes it's hard to know
what that is.

1369
01:37:20,918 --> 01:37:22,337
Do you understand?

1370
01:37:24,630 --> 01:37:26,257
I need your help, son.

1371
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:29,844
If I'm going to move on this...

1372
01:37:30,178 --> 01:37:33,348
...there can't be
the least little shred of doubt.

1373
01:37:34,098 --> 01:37:35,141
I have to know...

1374
01:37:35,308 --> 01:37:37,977
...if what you told Dufresne
was the truth.

1375
01:37:38,186 --> 01:37:39,312
Yes, sir.

1376
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:40,772
Absolutely.

1377
01:37:41,272 --> 01:37:44,275
Would you be willing to swear
before a judge and jury...

1378
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:46,444
...with your hand on the Good Book...

1379
01:37:46,652 --> 01:37:49,322
...and take an oath
before Almighty God himself?

1380
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:51,324
Just give me that chance.

1381
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:56,954
That's what I thought.

1382
01:38:10,468 --> 01:38:12,720
[DOGS BARKING]

1383
01:38:44,001 --> 01:38:45,920
I'm sure by now you've heard.

1384
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:48,714
Terrible thing.

1385
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:51,801
A man that young...

1386
01:38:52,135 --> 01:38:54,720
...less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1387
01:38:55,263 --> 01:38:57,765
Broke Captain Hadley's heart
to shoot him.

1388
01:38:58,516 --> 01:39:00,017
Truly, it did.

1389
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:05,440
We just have to put it behind us.

1390
01:39:07,108 --> 01:39:08,359
Move on.

1391
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:11,446
I'm done.

1392
01:39:12,738 --> 01:39:14,365
Everything stops.

1393
01:39:16,367 --> 01:39:18,703
Get someone else to run your scams.

1394
01:39:19,954 --> 01:39:21,789
Nothing stops.

1395
01:39:23,124 --> 01:39:24,500
Nothing.

1396
01:39:27,712 --> 01:39:30,798
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1397
01:39:31,215 --> 01:39:33,551
No more protection from the guards.

1398
01:39:33,718 --> 01:39:38,639
I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton
and cast you down with the sodomites.

1399
01:39:40,057 --> 01:39:42,477
You'll think you've been
fucked by a train.

1400
01:39:43,895 --> 01:39:45,396
And the library?

1401
01:39:46,063 --> 01:39:47,064
Gone.

1402
01:39:47,648 --> 01:39:50,234
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1403
01:39:50,693 --> 01:39:53,362
We'll have us a little
book barbecue in the yard.

1404
01:39:53,571 --> 01:39:55,698
They'll see the flames for miles.

1405
01:39:55,907 --> 01:39:58,743
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1406
01:39:59,994 --> 01:40:02,997
You understand me? Catching my drift?

1407
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:08,586
Or am I being obtuse?

1408
01:40:20,389 --> 01:40:23,017
Give him another month
to think about it.

1409
01:41:09,772 --> 01:41:12,817
My wife used to say
I'm a hard man to know.

1410
01:41:13,651 --> 01:41:15,486
Like a closed book.

1411
01:41:16,279 --> 01:41:18,322
Complained about it all the time.

1412
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:20,825
She was beautiful.

1413
01:41:23,202 --> 01:41:25,037
God, I loved her.

1414
01:41:28,457 --> 01:41:30,668
I didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1415
01:41:33,421 --> 01:41:35,089
I killed her, Red.

1416
01:41:36,966 --> 01:41:38,759
I didn't pull the trigger...

1417
01:41:40,177 --> 01:41:41,929
...but I drove her away.

1418
01:41:43,431 --> 01:41:46,142
That's why she died, because of me...

1419
01:41:46,309 --> 01:41:47,685
...the way I am.

1420
01:41:56,694 --> 01:41:58,529
That don't make you a murderer.

1421
01:42:01,907 --> 01:42:03,701
Bad husband, maybe.

1422
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:10,583
Feel bad about it if you want,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1423
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:12,126
No, I didn't.

1424
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:14,462
Somebody else did.

1425
01:42:15,713 --> 01:42:17,798
And I wound up in here.

1426
01:42:20,259 --> 01:42:21,886
Bad luck, I guess.

1427
01:42:24,764 --> 01:42:28,517
- Yeah.
- It floats around.

1428
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:31,771
It's got to land on somebody.

1429
01:42:32,688 --> 01:42:34,565
It was my turn, that's all.

1430
01:42:35,274 --> 01:42:38,069
I was in the path of the tornado.

1431
01:42:43,991 --> 01:42:47,953
I just didn't expect the storm
would last as long as it has.

1432
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:54,001
Think you'll ever get out of here?

1433
01:42:55,252 --> 01:42:56,671
Me?

1434
01:42:59,256 --> 01:43:00,591
Yeah.

1435
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:03,886
One day, when I got
a long, white beard...

1436
01:43:04,095 --> 01:43:08,182
...and two or three marbles rolling
around upstairs, they'll let me out.

1437
01:43:09,266 --> 01:43:10,935
I tell you where I'd go.

1438
01:43:12,395 --> 01:43:14,105
Zihuatanejo.

1439
01:43:14,939 --> 01:43:16,107
Say what?

1440
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:18,275
Zihuatanejo.

1441
01:43:19,193 --> 01:43:20,861
It's in Mexico.

1442
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:24,365
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1443
01:43:25,491 --> 01:43:28,285
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1444
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:32,123
- No.
- They say it has no memory.

1445
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:36,752
That's where I want to live
the rest of my life.

1446
01:43:38,379 --> 01:43:40,881
A warm place with no memory.

1447
01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:46,053
Open up a little hotel...

1448
01:43:47,763 --> 01:43:49,265
...right on the beach.

1449
01:43:49,849 --> 01:43:52,059
Buy some worthless old boat...

1450
01:43:52,601 --> 01:43:54,228
...and fix it up new.

1451
01:43:56,981 --> 01:43:58,190
Take my guests out...

1452
01:43:59,024 --> 01:44:00,401
...charter fishing.

1453
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:05,990
Zihuatanejo.

1454
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:13,372
In a place like that, I could use
a man that knows how to get things.

1455
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:22,757
I don't think I could make it
on the outside, Andy.

1456
01:44:29,430 --> 01:44:31,515
I been in here most of my life.

1457
01:44:32,933 --> 01:44:34,685
I'm an institutional man now.

1458
01:44:35,603 --> 01:44:37,354
Just like Brooks was.

1459
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:40,524
Well, you underestimate yourself.

1460
01:44:41,066 --> 01:44:42,693
I don't think so.

1461
01:44:46,530 --> 01:44:50,451
In here I'm the guy who can get things
for you, sure, but...

1462
01:44:51,202 --> 01:44:53,746
...outside all you need
is the Yellow Pages.

1463
01:44:53,954 --> 01:44:56,207
Hell, I wouldn't know
where to begin.

1464
01:44:58,334 --> 01:44:59,960
Pacific Ocean?

1465
01:45:00,377 --> 01:45:01,587
Shit.

1466
01:45:01,962 --> 01:45:04,173
Scare me to death, something that big.

1467
01:45:04,381 --> 01:45:05,674
Not me.

1468
01:45:06,884 --> 01:45:09,637
I didn't shoot my wife,
and I didn't shoot her lover.

1469
01:45:11,388 --> 01:45:14,600
Whatever mistakes I made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1470
01:45:15,643 --> 01:45:17,144
That hotel, that boat...

1471
01:45:18,896 --> 01:45:21,148
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1472
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:28,489
You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

1473
01:45:28,697 --> 01:45:30,741
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

1474
01:45:31,158 --> 01:45:33,619
Mexico is way down there
and you're in here...

1475
01:45:33,828 --> 01:45:35,412
...and that's the way it is.

1476
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:38,582
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

1477
01:45:40,084 --> 01:45:42,461
It's down there and I'm in here.

1478
01:45:45,047 --> 01:45:47,758
I guess it comes down
to a simple choice.

1479
01:45:50,678 --> 01:45:52,179
Get busy living...

1480
01:45:53,556 --> 01:45:55,599
...or get busy dying.

1481
01:45:59,228 --> 01:46:00,938
RED:
Andy.

1482
01:46:04,024 --> 01:46:05,693
ANDY:
Red?

1483
01:46:07,695 --> 01:46:10,447
If you ever get out of here,
do me a favor.

1484
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:12,908
Sure, Andy. Anything.

1485
01:46:14,785 --> 01:46:18,622
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1486
01:46:20,124 --> 01:46:23,252
- A lot of hayfields up there.
- One in particular.

1487
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:27,381
It's got a long rock wall
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1488
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:30,467
It's like something
out of a Robert Frost poem.

1489
01:46:31,385 --> 01:46:33,888
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1490
01:46:35,306 --> 01:46:37,391
We went there for a picnic...

1491
01:46:37,808 --> 01:46:39,894
...and made love under that oak...

1492
01:46:40,561 --> 01:46:42,813
...and I asked and she said yes.

1493
01:46:46,817 --> 01:46:48,652
Promise me, Red.

1494
01:46:49,486 --> 01:46:51,113
If you ever get out...

1495
01:46:51,322 --> 01:46:52,823
...find that spot.

1496
01:46:53,991 --> 01:46:58,829
At the base of that wall, there's a rock
that has no earthly business in Maine.

1497
01:46:59,955 --> 01:47:03,000
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

1498
01:47:05,669 --> 01:47:08,339
Something's buried under it
I want you to have.

1499
01:47:09,089 --> 01:47:10,341
What, Andy?

1500
01:47:10,758 --> 01:47:12,509
What's buried under there?

1501
01:47:14,094 --> 01:47:15,971
You'll have to pry it up...

1502
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:17,431
...to see.

1503
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:25,272
No, I'm telling you. The guy is...

1504
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:27,691
He's talking funny.

1505
01:47:28,776 --> 01:47:30,486
I'm really worried about him.

1506
01:47:30,861 --> 01:47:32,321
Let's keep an eye on him.

1507
01:47:32,529 --> 01:47:35,783
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's all alone.

1508
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:38,369
Oh, Lord.

1509
01:47:39,703 --> 01:47:41,288
What?

1510
01:47:42,039 --> 01:47:44,792
Andy come down
to the loading dock today.

1511
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,086
He asked me for a length of rope.

1512
01:47:47,294 --> 01:47:50,005
- Rope?
- Six feet long.

1513
01:47:50,214 --> 01:47:51,590
And you gave it to him.

1514
01:47:52,466 --> 01:47:54,259
Sure I did. Why wouldn't I?

1515
01:47:54,468 --> 01:47:56,053
Jesus! Heywood.

1516
01:47:56,637 --> 01:47:58,597
How was I supposed to know?

1517
01:47:58,806 --> 01:48:00,391
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1518
01:48:00,599 --> 01:48:04,311
No. Andy would never do that.

1519
01:48:04,895 --> 01:48:06,355
Never.

1520
01:48:08,065 --> 01:48:09,400
I don't know.

1521
01:48:12,236 --> 01:48:14,238
Every man has his breaking point.

1522
01:48:16,573 --> 01:48:18,867
Lickety-split. Want to get home.

1523
01:48:19,159 --> 01:48:20,911
Just about finished, sir.

1524
01:48:38,053 --> 01:48:39,680
Three deposits tonight.

1525
01:48:47,646 --> 01:48:49,565
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1526
01:48:49,773 --> 01:48:51,400
And shine my shoes.

02:05:33,276 --> 02:05:37,613
<i>...the place you live in is that much
more drab and empty that they're gone.</i>

1695
02:05:41,826 --> 02:05:44,203
<i>I guess I just miss my friend.</i>

1696
02:06:08,644 --> 02:06:09,812
Please sit down.

1697
02:06:15,651 --> 02:06:17,236
Ellis Boyd Redding...

1698
02:06:17,779 --> 02:06:21,032
...your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1699
02:06:21,824 --> 02:06:23,993
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1700
02:06:25,828 --> 02:06:27,413
Rehabilitated?

1701
02:06:29,457 --> 02:06:31,334
Well, now, let me see.

1702
02:06:32,335 --> 02:06:34,670
I don't have any idea what that means.

1703
02:06:36,798 --> 02:06:39,050
It means you're ready
to rejoin society--

1704
02:06:39,634 --> 02:06:41,969
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1705
02:06:44,138 --> 02:06:46,140
To me it's just a made-up word.

1706
02:06:47,475 --> 02:06:49,811
A politician's word so that...

1707
02:06:50,228 --> 02:06:53,773
...young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie...

1708
02:06:54,232 --> 02:06:55,858
...and have a job.

1709
02:06:57,819 --> 02:06:59,904
What do you really want to know?

1710
02:07:00,696 --> 02:07:02,657
Am I sorry for what I did?

1711
02:07:03,074 --> 02:07:04,367
Well, are you?

1712
02:07:06,160 --> 02:07:08,996
There's not a day goes by
I don't feel regret.

1713
02:07:10,373 --> 02:07:13,835
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1714
02:07:17,296 --> 02:07:19,882
I look back on the way I was then...

1715
02:07:22,009 --> 02:07:23,344
...a young...

1716
02:07:24,262 --> 02:07:27,765
...stupid kid who committed
that terrible crime.

1717
02:07:30,768 --> 02:07:32,478
I want to talk to him.

1718
02:07:34,397 --> 02:07:36,899
I want to try
and talk some sense to him.

1719
02:07:37,608 --> 02:07:39,569
Tell him the way things are.

1720
02:07:41,654 --> 02:07:43,072
But I can't.

1721
02:07:45,283 --> 02:07:47,285
That kid's long gone...

1722
02:07:48,494 --> 02:07:51,247
...and this old man is all that's left.

1723
02:07:52,665 --> 02:07:54,125
I got to live with that.

1724
02:07:55,501 --> 02:07:57,211
Rehabilitated?

1725
02:07:57,587 --> 02:07:59,422
It's just a bullshit word.

1726
02:08:00,339 --> 02:08:05,094
So you go on and stamp your forms,
sonny, and stop wasting my time.

1727
02:08:06,345 --> 02:08:08,598
Because to tell you the truth...

1728
02:08:08,931 --> 02:08:10,933
...I don't give a shit.

1729
02:09:37,478 --> 02:09:38,854
Here you go, miss.

1730
02:09:41,816 --> 02:09:42,858
Restroom break, boss?

1731
02:09:48,656 --> 02:09:53,202
You don't need to ask me every time you
need to go take a piss. Just go. Understand?

1732
02:09:54,203 --> 02:09:55,830
Yes, sir.

1733
02:10:06,215 --> 02:10:09,302
RED: <i>Forty years I've been asking
permission to piss.</i>

1734
02:10:10,136 --> 02:10:13,139
<i>I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.</i>

1735
02:10:16,642 --> 02:10:18,811
<i>There's a harsh truth to face.</i>

1736
02:10:20,479 --> 02:10:23,399
<i>No way I'm going to make it
on the outside.</i>

1737
02:10:31,240 --> 02:10:34,952
<i>All I do anymore is think of ways
to break my parole...</i>

1738
02:10:35,745 --> 02:10:38,247
<i>...so maybe they'd send me back.</i>

1739
02:10:43,419 --> 02:10:45,880
<i>Terrible thing, to live in fear.</i>

1740
02:10:46,756 --> 02:10:48,424
<i>Brooks Hatlen knew it.</i>

1741
02:10:48,632 --> 02:10:50,593
<i>Knew it all too well.</i>

1742
02:10:52,178 --> 02:10:55,598
<i>All I want is to be back
where things make sense.</i>

1743
02:10:56,015 --> 02:10:58,768
<i>Where I won't have to be afraid
all the time.</i>

1744
02:11:00,770 --> 02:11:03,105
<i>Only one thing stops me.</i>

1745
02:11:04,565 --> 02:11:06,942
<i>A promise I made to Andy.</i>

1746
02:11:27,463 --> 02:11:28,798
MAN:
There it is.

1747
02:11:39,225 --> 02:11:40,893
RED:
Much obliged, sir.

1748
02:15:20,195 --> 02:15:21,488
ANDY:
<i>Dear Red:</i>

1749
02:15:21,697 --> 02:15:24,199
<i>If you're reading this,
you've gotten out...</i>

1750
02:15:24,366 --> 02:15:28,537
<i>...and if you've come this far,
maybe you're willing to come a little further.</i>

1751
02:15:28,704 --> 02:15:31,206
<i>You remember the name
of the town, don't you?</i>

1752
02:15:33,500 --> 02:15:35,002
Zihuatanejo.

1753
02:15:36,629 --> 02:15:40,215
ANDY: <i>I could use a good man
to help me get my project on wheels.</i>

1754
02:15:40,716 --> 02:15:44,261
<i>I'll keep an eye out for you,
and the chessboard ready.</i>

1755
02:15:45,054 --> 02:15:46,472
<i>Remember, Red...</i>

1756
02:15:46,805 --> 02:15:48,891
<i>...hope is a good thing...</i>

1757
02:15:49,099 --> 02:15:51,101
<i>...maybe the best of things.</i>

1758
02:15:51,310 --> 02:15:53,479
<i>And no good thing ever dies.</i>

1759
02:15:54,021 --> 02:15:56,899
<i>I will be hoping
that this letter finds you...</i>

1760
02:15:57,066 --> 02:15:58,817
<i>...and finds you well.</i>

1761
02:15:59,318 --> 02:16:00,569
<i>Your friend...</i>

1762
02:16:00,736 --> 02:16:01,904
<i>...Andy.</i>

1763
02:16:35,771 --> 02:16:37,481
RED:
<i>"Get busy living...</i>

1764
02:16:37,690 --> 02:16:39,608
<i>...or get busy dying."</i>

1765
02:16:42,277 --> 02:16:44,446
<i>That's goddamn right.</i>

1766
02:16:49,702 --> 02:16:51,829
<i>For the second time in my life...</i>

1767
02:16:52,079 --> 02:16:54,623
<i>...I'm guilty of committing a crime.</i>

1768
02:16:55,708 --> 02:16:57,626
<i>Parole violation.</i>

1769
02:16:58,293 --> 02:17:01,964
<i>Of course, I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.</i>

1770
02:17:02,631 --> 02:17:04,675
<i>Not for an old crook like me.</i>

1771
02:17:04,883 --> 02:17:06,927
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1772
02:17:10,597 --> 02:17:15,310
RED: <i>I find I'm so excited I can barely
sit still or hold a thought in my head.</i>

1773
02:17:15,769 --> 02:17:19,106
<i>I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.</i>

1774
02:17:19,314 --> 02:17:21,817
<i>A free man at the start
of a long journey...</i>

1775
02:17:21,984 --> 02:17:24,611
<i>...whose conclusion is uncertain.</i>

1776
02:17:27,614 --> 02:17:30,284
<i>I hope I can make it across the border.</i>

1777
02:17:31,785 --> 02:17:34,830
<i>I hope to see my friend
and shake his hand.</i>

1778
02:17:36,665 --> 02:17:40,753
<i>I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.</i>

1779
02:17:42,588 --> 02:17:43,797
<i>I hope.</i>
