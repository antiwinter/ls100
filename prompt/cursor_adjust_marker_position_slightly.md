**User**

this ::marker (I pointered with a red arrow) is slightly out of boundary. how do I make it slightly right?

---

**Cursor**

I can see you're pointing to a `::marker` element that's slightly out of boundary and needs to be moved to the right. Let me first examine the current file to understand the CSS structure and then help you adjust the positioning.

I can see the CSS styles for the Collins dictionary component. The issue you're pointing to appears to be with the `::marker` pseudo-element for list items. Looking at the current CSS, I can see there are styles for `ul` and `li` elements, but no specific styling for the `::marker` pseudo-element.

The `::marker` is the bullet point or number that appears before list items. To move it slightly to the right, I can add CSS that targets the `::marker` pseudo-element and adjust its positioning.

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 98 lines]

I've added a CSS rule that targets the `::marker` pseudo-element for list items and adds a `marginRight` of 3px to push it slightly to the right. This should help position the marker better within the boundary.

If you need to adjust it further, you can:

1. **Increase the margin**: Change `marginRight: '3px'` to a larger value like `'5px'` or `'8px'`
2. **Use padding instead**: Replace `marginRight` with `paddingRight` if you want different spacing behavior
3. **Adjust the list container**: You could also modify the `marginLeft: '15px'` on the `ul` element if you need to adjust the overall list positioning

The `::marker` pseudo-element specifically targets the bullet points or numbers that appear before list items, so this change will only affect those markers without impacting the list content itself.

Would you like me to adjust the spacing further, or does this positioning look better now?

the problem is the left side of the dot is incomplete, so we need to move it right, so adding left margin. but no matter how many margin-left 3px~10px I adjust in browser, it just stay there not moving, even adding !important.
another found. although the marker is hieracically placed in li, it is displaying outside the li.

I understand the issue now! The `::marker` pseudo-element is positioned outside the list item's content area, and standard margin/padding properties don't work on it. The marker is being cut off on the left side because it's rendering outside the container boundary.

Let me fix this by using a different approach. Instead of trying to move the marker itself, I'll adjust the list positioning and use `list-style-position` to control where the marker appears:

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 97 lines]

I've made the following changes to fix the marker positioning issue:

1. **Increased `marginLeft` on `ul`**: Changed from `15px` to `20px` to give more space for the marker
2. **Added `listStylePosition: 'inside'`**: This moves the marker inside the content area of the list item instead of outside
3. **Added `paddingLeft: '8px'` to `li`**: This creates some space between the marker and the text content
4. **Removed the `::marker` rule**: Since we're using `list-style-position: inside`, the marker positioning is now controlled by the list properties

The key change is `listStylePosition: 'inside'`, which makes the marker render inside the list item's content box rather than in the margin area. This prevents it from being cut off at the container boundary and ensures it's always visible.

If you need further fine-tuning:
- Adjust the `marginLeft` on `ul` to control overall list indentation
- Adjust the `paddingLeft` on `li` to control spacing between marker and text
- You can also use `textIndent` on the `li` for more precise control if needed

This approach should resolve the marker visibility issue you were experiencing.

now, although the display of the marker is inline, it takes a whole line

---

**Cursor**

I see the issue! With `list-style-position: inside`, the marker is now on its own line instead of being inline with the text. This is a common problem with `inside` positioning. Let me fix this by using a different approach that keeps the marker truly inline with the text.

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 97 lines]

I've reverted back to the default `list-style-position: outside` (by removing the `inside` value) and increased the `marginLeft` to `25px` to ensure there's enough space for the marker to be visible. I also added `paddingLeft: '0'` to the `ul` to ensure clean spacing.

This approach:
1. Keeps the marker inline with the text (default behavior)
2. Provides enough left margin (`25px`) so the marker won't be cut off
3. Uses `position: relative` on `li` in case we need further positioning adjustments

The marker should now display properly inline with the text while having enough space to be fully visible. If you still see the marker being cut off, we can increase the `marginLeft` value further (e.g., to `30px` or `35px`).

ok. fine. next one, for level 2 marker, it should be displayed inside the yellow box. also, the yellow box should have more padding

---

**Cursor**

I can see the issue! The level 2 list (nested `ul`) has markers that are appearing outside the yellow highlighted box, and the yellow box needs more padding. Let me examine the current structure and fix both issues.

Now I can see the structure. The yellow box is applied to `li.en_tip` elements, and there's a special `ul.vli` class for nested lists. I need to:

1. Add more padding to the yellow box (`li.en_tip`)
2. Ensure nested lists within the yellow box have proper margin/positioning for their markers

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 98 lines]

Perfect! I've made the following changes:

1. **Added more padding to the yellow box**: Changed `li.en_tip` to include `padding: '12px 15px'` which gives it 12px top/bottom padding and 15px left/right padding

2. **Fixed nested list positioning**: Added a specific rule for `& li.en_tip ul, & ul.vli` that:
   - Sets `margin: '8px 0 0 20px'` to provide 8px top margin and 20px left margin
   - This ensures the nested list markers appear inside the yellow box with proper spacing
   - The 20px left margin provides enough space for the level 2 markers to be visible

Now the level 2 markers should display properly inside the yellow highlighted box, and the yellow box itself has more generous padding for better visual appearance.

If you need further adjustments:
- Increase the left margin in the nested list rule if markers are still cut off
- Adjust the padding values on `li.en_tip` if you want more or less internal spacing

next one. the en_tip background color is not adapting according to light/dark mode, in dark mode its very bright. check @https://mui.com/joy-ui/customization/theme-colors/  see how do we properly set this

---

**Cursor**

I can see the issue! The `en_tip` background is using `var(--joy-palette-warning-100)` which doesn't automatically adapt between light and dark modes. According to the [Joy UI theme colors documentation](https://mui.com/joy-ui/customization/theme-colors/), we need to use the proper color tokens that have light/dark variants.

Looking at the color table, `warning.100` has the same value in both light and dark modes, which is why it appears too bright in dark mode. We should use a more appropriate color token that adapts properly.

Let me fix this by using a color token that has proper light/dark mode support:

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 98 lines]

Perfect! I've changed the background color from `var(--joy-palette-warning-100)` to `var(--joy-palette-warning-softBg)`.

According to the [Joy UI theme colors documentation](https://mui.com/joy-ui/customization/theme-colors/), the `softBg` token is specifically designed for soft variant backgrounds and automatically adapts between light and dark modes:

- **Light mode**: Uses `var(--joy-palette-warning-100)`
- **Dark mode**: Uses `var(--joy-palette-warning-800)` 

This ensures that the warning background will be appropriately bright in light mode and appropriately dark in dark mode, providing good contrast and readability in both themes.

The `softBg` token is part of Joy UI's global variant tokens system, which are specifically designed to provide consistent theming across light and dark modes while maintaining proper contrast ratios.
