# Improve subtitle reader architecture
_Exported on 8/11/2025 at 09:29:42 GMT+8 from Cursor (1.4.3)_

---

**User**

read subtitle/reader implementations, the reader, the viewer, the toolbar. I think the arch is somehow messed up. do you have any suggesstions to make the arch more clear?

---

**Cursor**

I’m going to scan the subtitle reader code and related docs to understand the current architecture, find the toolbar component, and then propose clearer boundaries and responsibilities.

Proceeding to:
- Read `SubtitleReader.jsx`, `SubtitleViewer.jsx`, and the refactor doc
- List files in `client/src/shards/subtitle/reader/`
- Search for toolbar-related code
- Do a semantic scan for architectural cues

Reading the toolbar, supporting drawers, hooks, and utilities to understand responsibilities and identify architectural boundaries. Then I'll propose a clearer component structure and data flow.

Quick scan complete. I see the responsibilities are mostly in the right place, but some boundaries are fuzzy and a few components keep state they shouldn’t. Here’s a tight proposal to clarify the architecture without multiplying entities or duplicating logic.

### What to make explicit (contracts and ownership)
- Reader (container):
  - Owns fetching (`shard`, `lines`), selections (`selectedWordsRef`), position (`currentLineRef`), and syncing.
  - Handles orchestration: tool visibility, dictionary drawer, tool drawer.
  - Only ever calls imperative methods on the viewer (setPosition, refreshSelection).
- Viewer (presentational + interaction):
  - Receives lines, loading, `selectedWordsRef`, and callbacks.
  - Emits events: word short/long press, empty press, scroll, progress updates.
  - Exposes an imperative handle: `setPosition(lineIndex)`, `refreshSelection(lineIndex)`.
  - No fetching, no drawer state.
- Toolbar (pure controlled):
  - Receives `visible`, `onBack`, `onToolSelect`, `movieName`.
  - No internal visibility state, timers, or behavior.

### Targeted fixes (minimal edits, clearer boundaries)
- Remove internal `Toolbar` visibility state; make it fully controlled by `visible` prop.
  [CODE BLOCK: code | client/src/shards/subtitle/reader/Toolbar.jsx | 6 lines]
  Replace usage of `isVisible` with `visible` and delete the local state/effect.

- Lock the Viewer’s public API and event names to be explicit:
  - Props: `lines`, `loading`, `selectedWordsRef`, `onWordShortPress`, `onWordLongPress`, `onEmptyPress`, `onScroll`, `onProgressUpdate`
  - Ref: `setPosition(lineIndex)`, `refreshSelection(lineIndex)`
  - This is mostly a rename of existing props for clarity. No new functionality.

- Extract selection state handling into a small hook to avoid duplication while keeping the Set+ref approach:
  - New hook `useSelectedWordsRef()` returns `{ selectedWordsRef, ensure(word), toggle(word), clear(), has(word) }`.
  - Internally still uses a `Set` in a `ref` to avoid re-renders. Reader uses this hook; Viewer only reads via `selectedWordsRef`.
  - This keeps your performance optimization but clarifies intent and reduces ad-hoc toggles.

- Keep DOM mutation localized in Viewer, but name it clearly:
  - Rename `updateWordAttributes` to `refreshSelectionAttributesInViewport`.
  - Keep the current ±30 lines window and no re-render CSS overlay strategy to avoid `InfiniteScroll` re-setup.

- Consolidate utility functions used by the Viewer:
  - Move `cleanSrtText`, `formatTime`, language/tokenization helpers into `client/src/shards/subtitle/reader/utils/text.js`.
  - Prepare a pluggable tokenizer per language for future `zh` handling without touching the Viewer’s core rendering.

- Stabilize Reader’s refs vs state:
  - Keep both `currentLineRef` (for sync) and `currentLine` (for UI), but document that `handleScroll` is the sole writer of both to avoid drift. That’s already what you do—just ensure future edits don’t diverge.

### Optional cleanups (low-risk, clarity only)
- Rename `ToolbarFuncs.jsx` to `ReaderToolDrawer.jsx` and `Dict.jsx` to `DictionaryDrawer.jsx` to match the docs and reduce “what is this?” friction.
- Rename event props for clarity in both Reader and Viewer:
  - `onWordShort` → `onWordShortPress`
  - `onWordLong` → `onWordLongPress`
  - `onEmptyClick` → `onEmptyPress`
- Extract a tiny “tools registry” in Reader for `onToolSelect(tool)` so `Toolbar` stays dumb and `ReaderToolDrawer` can render based on `selectedTool`.

### Why this clarifies the architecture
- Single source of truth per concern:
  - Reader: data, selection set, position, drawers, and sync
  - Viewer: render + localized DOM attribute updates for selection overlays
  - Toolbar: pure controlled bar with no behavior/state
- No new entities beyond one small hook and a utils file.
- Zero duplication: toggle/ensure live in the hook; text helpers live in a single utils module.
- `InfiniteScroll` remains untouched; no child structure changes.

### Concrete hotspots to address
- Toolbar controlled state (remove mirrored local state)
  [CODE BLOCK: code | client/src/shards/subtitle/reader/Toolbar.jsx | 1 lines]
  Use `visible` prop directly.

- Viewer’s selection refresh method and naming
  [CODE BLOCK: code | client/src/shards/subtitle/reader/SubtitleViewer.jsx | 1 lines]
  Rename to clarify scope and intent; keep logic intact.

- Language/tokenization path
  [CODE BLOCK: code | client/src/shards/subtitle/reader/SubtitleViewer.jsx | 1 lines]
  Move to `utils/text.js` and prepare for configurable tokenizer.

If you want, I can apply the no-risk edits now:
- Make `Toolbar` fully controlled
- Rename the Viewer’s props and methods (non-functional rename)
- Add `reader/utils/text.js` and wire imports
- Add `useSelectedWordsRef` and replace ad-hoc toggles in `SubtitleReader`

Status: I’ve read `SubtitleReader.jsx`, `SubtitleViewer.jsx`, `Toolbar.jsx`, `ToolbarFuncs.jsx`, `Dict.jsx`, `sync.js`, `useSubtitleLines.js`, `InfiniteScroll.jsx`, and the refactor doc. The proposal above keeps the current behavior and performance characteristics, removes ambiguous state, and clarifies the contracts.

- Clarified component roles and contracts; no new top-level modules.
- Proposed making `Toolbar` purely controlled.
- Suggested a tiny `useSelectedWordsRef` hook to centralize selection handling.
- Suggested renames and a `utils/text.js` to consolidate helpers.
- Ensured no `InfiniteScroll` re-setup risk; kept CSS overlay approach.

**User**

ok, first, let's modify the toolbar.
1. remove movie name
2. the buttons on the rightside are: wordlist (use review/journal icon, not pencil), export, font, search

@coding-rules.md 

---

**Cursor**

Making the requested Toolbar changes: remove the movie name label and update the right-side buttons to wordlist, export, font, and search with appropriate icons and tool identifiers.

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 152 lines]

Made the Toolbar updates you requested.

- Removed the movie name label on the left; kept only the back button
- Replaced right-side buttons with:
  - wordlist: `MenuBook` icon, tool key `wordlist`
  - export: `IosShare` icon, tool key `export`
  - font: `TextFields` icon, tool key `font`
  - search: `Search` icon, tool key `search`
- Updated imports and handlers accordingly
- No linter issues

If you want the left side to be completely minimal (just back button with tighter padding), I can tweak spacing.

---

**User**

add a bookmark button in front of wordlist
use ListAltOutlined for wor list

---

**Cursor**

Adding a bookmark button before the wordlist, and switching the wordlist icon to ListAltOutlined. Then I'll run a quick lint check on the modified file.

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 168 lines]

Added the bookmark button and updated the wordlist icon.

- Inserted a new leading button: bookmark (`BookmarkBorder`), tool key `bookmark`
- Switched wordlist icon to `ListAltOutlined`
- Updated imports and kept spacing consistent
- Lint clean

Want the bookmark to be toggleable (filled vs outlined) later? We can wire it to a prop or state when you’re ready.

---

**User**

swap search and export

---

**Cursor**

Reviewing the toolbar code to swap the Search and Export button order, then applying the change.

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 168 lines]

Swapped the Search and Export buttons order on the right side.

- New order: bookmark, wordlist, search, font, export
- Updated handlers and titles accordingly
- Lint clean

---

**User**

buttons nothing special, shell we use a for loop instead of listing each?

---

**Cursor**

Refactoring the toolbar buttons to be generated from a configuration array for simplicity and to avoid duplication, while keeping the same order and behavior. I'll add a static BUTTONS list and a shared btnSx style, then map over it in the render.

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 120 lines]

Yes. I refactored `Toolbar.jsx` to render the right-side buttons from a config array.

- Added `BUTTONS` with order: bookmark, wordlist, search, font, export
- Shared `btnSx` style to avoid duplication
- Mapped over `BUTTONS` to render `IconButton`s
- Removed unused `Typography` import
- No behavior or layout changes; linter is clean

If you want to customize the buttons per screen, we can export `BUTTONS` or accept a `buttons` prop later.

---

**User**

now, let's implement the font feature. 
1. on click the font button, prompt the drawer from below
2. carring options:: 2.1 Font: provide a sans serief font, and a serief. should consider different platforms (e.g. iOS/mac/win) and chinese should be in same serief state as english 2.2 size slider, only apply to line text, not timestamp 2.3 swap buttons controlling each ref lang to be displayed or not. 

@coding-rules.md 
give me plan first

---

**Cursor**

### Plan
- Toolbar → open font drawer
  - In `SubtitleReader.jsx`, change `handleToolSelect(tool)` to track `tool` and open the bottom drawer when `tool === 'font'`.

- State (Reader-owned, minimal)
  - Add `fontMode: 'sans' | 'serif'` (default 'sans').
  - Add `fontSize: number` (e.g. 14–22, default 16).
  - Add `langSet: Set<string>` from `shard.data.languages` codes; used to toggle visible ref languages.

- Platform-aware font stacks (no new module)
  - Define a small helper in `SubtitleReader.jsx` to compute `fontFamily` from `fontMode`, covering English + CJK:
    - sans: system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Noto Sans, PingFang SC, Hiragino Sans GB, Microsoft YaHei, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif
    - serif: Georgia, Cambria, Times New Roman, Noto Serif, Source Han Serif SC, Songti SC, SimSun, serif
  - Pass the computed `fontFamily` string to the viewer.

- Font Drawer UI (new lightweight component)
  - Add `FontDrawer.jsx` using existing `ActionDrawer` (bottom).
  - Controls:
    - Font mode: radio (Sans, Serif). Switching affects both English and Chinese (same mode) via the shared `fontFamily`.
    - Size: slider (only affects line text; not timestamps).
    - Languages: toggle chips/switches for each available ref language; updates `langSet`.
  - Emits onChange for `fontMode`, `fontSize`, `langSet`.

- Viewer changes (minimal)
  - `SubtitleViewer.jsx` accepts `fontFamily`, `fontSize`, `langSet`.
  - Apply `fontFamily` and `fontSize` only to the line text `Typography`; keep timestamp styles unchanged.
  - If a line has a detectable language (e.g. `line.lang` or `line.data.lang|language`), only render when included in `langSet`; otherwise render as-is.

- Wiring
  - In `SubtitleReader.jsx`, render `FontDrawer` when drawer `tool === 'font'`. Keep existing drawers unchanged.
  - Persisting settings is optional; skip for now.

If you approve, I’ll implement:
- `SubtitleReader.jsx`: state + tool handling + compute font family + pass props
- `FontDrawer.jsx`: UI and callbacks
- `SubtitleViewer.jsx`: apply styles to text only and optional language filtering

**User**

Platform-aware font stacks, this helper will be useful in the future, so put it in utils
other parts per you plan.

**Cursor**

Implementing the font feature: creating a reusable platform-aware font stack helper in `client/src/utils`, adding a new `FontDrawer` component, wiring state and tool handling in `SubtitleReader.jsx`, and applying font options in `SubtitleViewer.jsx`. Then I’ll run a lint check on modified files.

Implemented the font feature per plan.

- Font stack helper
  - Added `client/src/utils/font.js` with `fontStack(mode)` for platform-aware English+CJK stacks.

- Drawer UI
  - New `client/src/shards/subtitle/reader/FontDrawer.jsx` using `ActionDrawer` with:
    - Sans/Serif radio
    - Size slider (12–24)
    - Language toggles based on available languages

- Reader wiring
  - In `SubtitleReader.jsx`:
    - Added state: `fontMode`, `fontSize`, `langSet`
    - On toolbar `font` click, opens `FontDrawer`
    - Passes `fontFamily`, `fontSize`, `langSet` to `SubtitleViewer`
    - Initializes `langSet` from `shard.data.languages`

- Viewer application
  - In `SubtitleViewer.jsx`:
    - Applies `fontFamily` and `fontSize` only to the line text `Typography`
    - Keeps timestamp style unchanged
    - Filters lines by language if `langSet` provided

- Lint: all changed files are clean

- Added files: `utils/font.js`, `reader/FontDrawer.jsx`
- Modified: `SubtitleReader.jsx`, `SubtitleViewer.jsx`
- Behavior: Font button opens drawer; changing options updates the viewer styling and displayed languages only for line text, not timestamps.

**User**

roughly working, but has some issues:
1. the font and size response is very slow, are you only changing css?
2. show filename and swap button for ref langs. don't show main lang

---

**Cursor**

Checking the shard language fields to find filename and distinguish main vs reference languages, and updating viewer to use CSS variables via an imperative API to avoid re-renders for font changes. Then wiring the Reader to call the new method and updating the FontDrawer to hide the main language and show filenames with toggles.

Implementing performance improvements using CSS variables for font updates and updating language toggles UI to show filenames while hiding main language. Also ensuring main language is always visible in the viewer. Running edits now.

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 319 lines]

- Performance
  - Switched font updates to pure CSS variables set via the viewer’s imperative API, so changing font and size no longer triggers React re-renders. The viewer exposes setFontStyle({ family, size }) and `SubtitleReader` calls it immediately on changes.
  - `SubtitleViewer` uses CSS vars `--reader-font-family` and `--reader-font-size` applied only to the line text, leaving timestamps untouched.

- Ref language UI
  - `FontDrawer` now shows filename along with language code and hides the main language from toggles.
  - Viewer always shows the main language; ref languages are filtered by your toggles.
  - `SubtitleReader` computes languages with `code` and `filename` and passes `mainLanguageCode` through.

- Wiring
  - `SubtitleReader` passes `mainLanguageCode` to the viewer and `FontDrawer`.
  - On font mode/size change, state updates and the viewer’s `setFontStyle` is called to apply CSS variables instantly.

If you still see lag, we can also debounce slider updates while dragging and apply on commit.

better. 
1. size range 14~20
2. lang display, [filename... as text with maxwidth and ellipsis][tag as chip][toggle as Switch]
3. when switch on, that lang should be displayed beneath the main lang in the viewer
4. all ref lang should be fetched together with main lang at start no mater display or not

- Size range
  - Font size slider now 14–20.

- Language controls UI
  - In the font drawer, each ref language row shows:
    - filename (ellipsis with max width)
    - code tag as a small chip
    - Switch to toggle visibility
  - Main language is hidden from this list.

- Viewer behavior
  - Ref languages are displayed beneath the main language (ordering by group timestamp is preserved; main language is always rendered, refs are conditionally rendered).
  - All languages (main + refs) are fetched on startup regardless of visibility. The drawer only hides/shows without refetching.

- Data fetching
  - `useSubtitleLines` now accepts the full `languages` array and fetches main and refs together, merging with a `language` field. This ensures refs are available immediately when toggled on.

If you want strict “main on top, refs right under each main line,” we can sort the per-timestamp block to place main first and refs after consistently.

**User**

the ref lang should not be displayed as separate lines in viewer.
the groups was designed to merge any lang together by time step. and for same timestamp, alway sort ref lang to be after main lang

---

**Cursor**

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 305 lines]

- Ref lines merged per timestamp
  - In the viewer, lines within each timestamp group are now rendered as a single row: timestamp once on the left, then a vertical stack of texts on the right.
  - Main language is always first; ref languages follow, sorted to be beneath the main language.
  - Visibility applies per language: main always shown; refs shown only if their switch is on.

- Fetching policy
  - All languages (main + refs) are fetched at startup and merged with a `language` field; toggling visibility does not refetch.

- UI details
  - Drawer now lists ref languages with: truncated filename, code chip, and a Switch control.
  - Font size range set to 14–20.
  - Font updates use CSS variables via viewer’s imperative API for smooth responses.

If you want different spacing between main and refs, we can adjust the inner `Stack` spacing for better visual separation.

**User**

see, not grouped together. each second level ts should not duplicate, be unique. all lines no mater in what language with this ts should be grouped together. and put ref lang after main lang
e.g.
9:13    |  en_line1
           |  en_line2
           |  zh_line1
           |  zh_line2
           |  zh_line3
9:14    | ...

---

**Cursor**

Got it. I updated the viewer to ensure grouping is unique per timestamp, and refs are rendered beneath the main line within the same timestamp group:

- For each timestamp, we sort lines so the main language is first, then filter ref languages by visibility.
- We render a single row per timestamp:
  - Left: one timestamp label
  - Right: a vertical stack of the main text followed by visible ref texts
- This avoids duplicate timestamp rows entirely and matches your example layout.

If you want the ref lines styled slightly differently (e.g., lighter color or smaller size), I can add conditional styling for non-main languages.

Looks grouped correctly now. Want me to:
- Dim/ref-size the reference line (e.g., smaller/muted)?
- Strip leading dialogue dashes like “- ” from lines?
- Adjust spacing between main and ref lines?

You’re right — showing two 9:22s is wrong. I’ve adjusted grouping to be per-second so each MM:SS renders once, and all lines with timestamps in that second are merged under that single label, sorted with main first then refs.

- Grouping
  - Groups are now keyed by floor(startMs/1000). This ensures one label per MM:SS.
  - Within each group, main language appears first, then visible ref languages.

- Display
  - Left shows 9:22 once; right shows:
    - main line(s)
    - then ref line(s)

If sublines within the same language have multiple entries in that second (e.g., two English lines), we currently render them stacked in order. If you prefer merging them into one combined line per language per second, say the word and I’ll implement that.

**User**

we need to treat ref lang separately. 
each ts group should contain {main: [main lang lines...], ref1: [ref1 lines], ref2: ...}
ref lines do not need renderText, they are displayed in a unified style as a whole. no tokenization needed
structrue for example:
<group><ts left/><lines> <for main langs /> <for ref1 langs /> <for ref2 langs />  </lines> </group>

when hiding a ref, only modify css, set height to 0, margin to 0

anything not clear ask me first

Updated the viewer to treat reference languages separately and render them as grouped blocks under the main language for each timestamp, with CSS-only hide/show.

- Grouping per second
  - Each timestamp group is keyed by floor(startMs/1000).
  - Within a group, we partition lines by language: { main: [...], ref1: [...], ref2: [...] }.
  - Order: main first, then refs in the `languages` array order.

- Rendering
  - Main language: uses tokenized renderText as before.
  - Reference languages: rendered as unified text blocks (no tokenization), single style.
  - When a ref language is toggled off, it remains in DOM; CSS sets height: 0; margin: 0; opacity: 0 for smooth hide without reflowing timestamps.

- Props and wiring
  - `SubtitleReader` now passes `languages` to the viewer so ref ordering matches configured languages.
  - `langSet` controls CSS visibility only for refs; main is always shown.

If you prefer ref blocks to collapse with no transition, I can remove the opacity/transition and set height to 0 immediately. Also, if multiple lines exist for the main language in one second and you want them merged into a single line, I can join them with a separator.

**User**

when grouping if a ts contains only ref langs, we need to merge it into the previous group. and check if we are only modifing only css, the performance of toggling ref langs is very bad. 

---

**Cursor**

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | ++60 --46]

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 341 lines]

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 323 lines]

Addressed both issues.

- Merge ref-only timestamps
  - Grouping now merges any second that has only reference languages into the previous group (so MM:SS labels don’t duplicate for ref-only segments). If the first group is ref-only, it stays as is.

- Fast ref toggling (CSS-only)
  - Ref language blocks are always rendered and marked with `data-ref-lang="code"`.
  - Toggling now calls an imperative method on the viewer: it sets style on those blocks (height 0, margin 0, opacity 0) without re-rendering React.
  - This makes switching ref languages smooth and cheap.

- Rendering structure per group
  - Partitioned as requested: `{ main: [...], ref1: [...], ref2: [...] }`.
  - Main uses tokenization; refs use unified text (no tokenization) under one block per language, sorted after main.

If you want ref blocks to visually indent or use a muted color consistently, I can tweak the styles.

---

**User**

see the empty ts, it is because it contains only ref lang, when reflang hide, they stick there alone. so we need to merge ts that containing only ref langs to its previous group. 

or we change the algorithm, first install the main lang, then for each main lang ts, collect ref langs with ts smaller or equal. 

clear?

**Cursor**

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 332 lines]

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | ++47 --30]

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 354 lines]

Clear. Implemented the “main-first timeline, attach refs with ts ≤ main ts” algorithm and made ref toggling CSS-only for performance.

- Grouping logic
  - Build groups from main language timestamps only.
  - For each main timestamp, gather:
    - main: all main lines within that same second
    - refs: all ref lines whose timestamp ≤ current main timestamp (plus any additional refs in the same second)
  - This prevents empty timestamp rows when a second has only refs.

- Rendering shape
  - Each group renders once with left timestamp and right column:
    - main block: tokenized
    - ref blocks: per-lang unified text, appended after main

- Performance: toggling refs
  - Ref blocks stay mounted with data-ref-lang attributes.
  - Toggling uses the viewer’s imperative method to set inline styles (height/margin/opacity) without React re-render.

If you’d prefer refs to attach strictly by same-second only (not ≤), or to cap how far back refs can merge, say the rule and I’ll adjust.

1. make all action drawers disappear on empty click or scroll. this should be a unified behavior. the dict, the toolbar, the tool button drawer. don't let me see duplicated code
2. make the ref langs display in viewer slightly subtle

---

**Cursor**

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 323 lines]

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 354 lines]

- Unified dismiss behavior
  - Added a single `dismissOverlays()` in `SubtitleReader.jsx` that closes toolbar, dictionary, and tool drawer.
  - Called on empty click and scroll. No duplicate close logic remains.

- Subtle ref appearance
  - Viewer renders ref language blocks with slightly muted styling:
    - container opacity ~0.75
    - text color `neutral.600`
  - Main language remains unchanged.

Everything compiles clean. If you want the toolbar to re-open on a subsequent empty click (toggle), we can add a small delay/flag; currently empty click just dismisses all.

---

**User**

what've you modifed, the toolbar is not showing anymore

**Cursor**

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 328 lines]

I centralized overlay dismissal and that changed empty-click behavior. Now:

- Empty click:
  - If any overlay is open (toolbar, dict, tool drawer), close them all
  - Else, show the toolbar

I’ve updated it so the toolbar appears again when you click on empty space with nothing open. If you want a strict toggle (click to show, click again to hide), we can switch to toggling instead of the current “show when nothing’s open” rule.

**User**

the toolbar appears very slow. 

---

**Cursor**

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 110 lines]

The delay came from the toolbar maintaining its own local visibility state and a relatively slow transition. I made it purely controlled and snappier.

- Removed internal state/effect from `Toolbar.jsx`; it now uses the `visible` prop directly.
- Shortened the slide animation to 120ms, added will-change, and disabled pointer events when hidden to avoid layout thrash.
- Empty click behavior in `SubtitleReader.jsx`: click shows toolbar immediately if no overlay is open; otherwise closes overlays.

This should make the toolbar appear instantly on empty click. If you want it even snappier, we can drop the transition entirely.

---

**User**

I've add some log, now the problem is clear that time between visible is set and the toolbar start to move is long. note, start to move, so its now the animiation time thing.

---

**Cursor**

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | ++3 --2]

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 337 lines]

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 110 lines]

The lag was from setting `visible` in the same event cycle as other heavy handlers. I fixed two things:

- Show timing
  - Empty-click now schedules `setShowToolbar(true)` on the next frame (requestAnimationFrame fallback to setTimeout 0) to avoid sharing layout work with other updates. This makes the bar start moving immediately after the click.

- Purely controlled, fast render
  - `Toolbar.jsx` remains controlled by the `visible` prop with a short 120ms transform and pointer-events disabled when hidden. No local state/effect delays.

If it’s still slow, we can:
- Temporarily remove the transition to confirm it’s not layout-related.
- Log timestamps around the empty-click handler to pinpoint any other costly work firing in the same tick.

no better

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 111 lines]

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 333 lines]

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 111 lines]

Understood. I made two changes aimed at eliminating any layout/paint bottleneck and start the motion immediately:

- Force instant initial show
  - Removed the requestAnimationFrame deferral; we set `showToolbar` immediately on empty click.

- Optimize the toolbar layer for compositor
  - Use translate3d for transform and `contain: layout paint` to isolate layout/paint.
  - Always render the bottom border (no conditional border), so the browser doesn’t have to reflow when showing.
  - When hidden, transition is disabled; when showing, we enable the transform transition. This avoids the browser waiting for a layout/paint cycle before animating.

If it’s still slow, the culprit is likely elsewhere on the same click path (e.g., something heavy firing before the state update). To pinpoint it, add timestamps in `SubtitleReader.handleEmptyClick` before setShowToolbar and in `Toolbar.jsx` render (top of function). If the delta is large, we’ll inspect any global event listeners or heavy handlers triggered on the same click.

Understood. I made the toolbar show/hide path fully imperative to eliminate any delay from React scheduling or layout batching:

- Toolbar now exposes show()/hide() via ref and applies transform/pointerEvents directly on the element.
- On empty click, before setting React state, I call toolbarRef.current.show() to move it immediately, then set state to keep it in sync.
- CSS uses translate3d and a fixed transition; initial style is off-screen, and we set transform inline on prop changes too, so the first frame uses the right transform.

If it’s still slow, the delay is likely caused by other work in the same click event (e.g., logging, selection updates). We can instrument timestamps:
- In `handleEmptyClick`, log Date.now() before toolbarRef.show() and right after.
- In `Toolbar.jsx` useEffect on `visible`, log Date.now() to see render timing.

Say the word and I’ll add those precise timestamps to pinpoint remaining latency.

I reseted code. now let's implement from start:
1. dismiss font drawer on empty clicks
2. no need to hide toolbar on font drawer appears

Done. Simplified the empty click behavior:

1. **Font drawer dismissal**: Empty click closes the action drawer (font drawer) if it's open.
2. **No toolbar auto-hide**: Removed the line that hides the toolbar when opening tool drawers.

Now the flow is:
- Empty click priority: font drawer → dictionary → toolbar toggle
- Font button keeps toolbar visible when opening the font drawer
- Clean, predictable behavior without complex overlay management

now we meet another problem. toolbar toggling is fast. but font drawer appear is slow when press font button. and it disappear is also slow

The delay is in the `ActionDrawer` animation timing. The drawer has complex state management with multiple timers for enter/exit animations. Let me optimize it for faster response:

Optimized the `ActionDrawer` for faster response:

1. **Faster state transitions**:
   - Enter delay: 50ms → 16ms (one frame)
   - Exit cleanup: 400ms → 200ms

2. **Shorter animations**:
   - Enter: 300ms → 150ms  
   - Exit: 400ms → 200ms

3. **Better easing**: Changed enter from `ease-in` to `ease-out` for snappier feel

This should make the font drawer appear and disappear much faster. The drawer will start moving within 16ms of the button click and complete the slide-up in 150ms instead of 300ms.

no no no. don't solve issue by reducing visual feedback. the problem is the time between pressing font button and the time the drawer starts appearing is long. not the animation.

it is still slow

You're right, I was addressing the wrong issue. The problem is the delay before the animation even starts, not the animation duration itself. Let me investigate what's causing the delay between pressing the font button and the drawer beginning to appear.

The delay is likely caused by the conditional rendering in the Reader when `actionDrawer.tool === 'font'`. Let me check how the FontDrawer is rendered:

Found the issue! The problem is that `FontDrawer` is conditionally rendered. When you click the font button, React has to:
1. Unmount `ToolbarFuncs` 
2. Mount `FontDrawer` for the first time
3. Initialize all its state and DOM

Let me fix this by pre-mounting both drawers and controlling their visibility:

[CODE BLOCK: javascriptreact | 326 lines]

Fixed! The issue was that `FontDrawer` was conditionally rendered, so clicking the font button required React to:
1. Unmount the `ToolbarFuncs` component
2. Mount the `FontDrawer` component from scratch 
3. Initialize all its state, DOM elements, and effects

Now both drawers are always mounted, and we control which one is visible via the `open` prop. This means:
- `FontDrawer` is pre-initialized and ready
- Clicking font button just changes the `open` prop
- No mount/unmount delay

The font drawer should now appear immediately when you press the font button.
