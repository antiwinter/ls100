no, you are only doing a research, don't mess up with the app implementation, 
  we're not in that stage yet. so imo only the first two and last two item in todo 
  list. don't search many provider, 2~3 is enough. further, when implementing 
  provider code, implement only one first. we test one pass, then others

---
now, let's do our next research according to @plan.md:
research target:
1. **Dictionary API Integration**
   - Research free dictionary APIs (Free Dictionary API, Merriam-Webster, etc.)
   - Create `server/dictionary.js` with multiple providers
   - Implement fallback system: Collins â†’ Online APIs

create a plan for this research that include how to implement test code and what should be included in the report

refer to @plan.md, let's first implement some code to do some research 
  on:
  1. Subtitle Search API Integration: test what services available, 
  whether we can search, download from them. put code and report in 
  research/subtile_service  tell me what's your plan to do the research
